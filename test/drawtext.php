# Unit test: PHPlot DrawText function - Alignment.
# This is a unit test. It does not draw a graph, but does produce an image file.
# The image shows text with all 9 cases of alignment:
#    (top|center|bottom)+(right|center|left)
# Notes: After PHPlot-5.0.4, top/bottom alignment were switched. They
# were wrong before.
# Unlike other test scripts, this is more dependent on PHPlot internals,
# such as the font[] structure.
# This script is also used to create documentation for text alignment.
# It uses a debug callback to get the orthogonal bounding box.
#
# Note: This could be called alone, but isn't. There is another script
# which sets no parameters and calls this. That was only so the filenames
# would be consistent. The other script is: drawtext-gd_000d_1l.php
# (for: GD text, 0 degrees, 1 line of text).
#
# Font info is in this configuration file:
require 'config.php';
#
# This is a parameterized test. Other scripts can set $tp and then include
# this script. The parameters are shown in the defaults array below:
if (!isset($tp)) $tp = array();
$tp = array_merge(array(
  'use_ttf' => False,        # True to use TTF text, False for GD text
  'gd_font_size' => 3,       # GD font of size
  'ttfont' => $phplot_test_ttfonts['sans'],  # TrueType font filename
  'ttfdir' => $phplot_test_ttfdir,   # TrueType font directory
  'ttfsize' => 10,    # TrueType font size in points
  'textangle' => 0,   # Text angle. GD fonts only allow 0 and 90.
  'nlines' => 1,      # Number of lines of text (>= 1)
  'line_spacing' => NULL,  # Line spacing, or NULL for default.
        ), $tp);

# For PHPlot-5.0.5 and earlier, this would directly set its own font[] array
# with members that we knew PHPlot drawtext() uses. But this changed after
# PHPlot-5.0.5, when mixed text types are supported. The goal now is to use
# PHPlot's own SetFont() methods to set up the array, then peak inside to
# see whether it is the old one or new one font array name, and copy it out.
