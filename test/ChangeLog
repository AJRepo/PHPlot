This is the Change Log for phplottest, the PHPlot Test Suite
The project home page is http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplot/
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2016-01-01
    New tests for Feature Request #59, legend border color/disable control:
    * legendborder*.php: Added 7 new tests.
    * tests.ini: List 7 new tests.

2015-11-03
    Fixes needed to complete PHPlot-6.2.0 release testing:
    * config.php: Fix for Ubuntu, font path has changed (no more ttf- prefix).
      This caused a large number of tests using TTF to fail on Ubuntu.
    * u.defaultfont.php: Use the test class PHPlot_test2 that also prevents
      error images from being drawn, which was making it hard to diagnose
      other font problems.
    * compare_tests.php : Add a "second try" file comparison function. If
      image files do not match byte-for-byte, try converting them to PNM and
      then compare the results. This cleared up about 900 image differ
      reports on Ubuntu, apparently because on Ubuntu some meta-data is
      being added to the images (resolution?) and this caused the byte-by-byte
      compares to fail even if the images are identical.
    * piesize.php: Use full path for TrueType font file. (Otherwise this fails
      with some PHP configurations. Font without path is tested elsewhere.)
    * ex-pieangle.php: Set the path for TrueType font files, to prevent
      test failures on some PHP configurations (thread safety enabled).

2015-10-31
    New tests for data borders with area fill plot types:
    * areaborders??.php: 24 new tests
    * tests.ini: List 24 new tests.

2015-10-28
    * ex-squaredarea1.php, ex-stackedsquaredarea1.php: style changes for
      inclusion in the reference manual.

2015-10-25
    New tests for 'squaredarea' and 'stackedsquaredarea' plot types:
    * squarea*.php: 22 new tests for new plot types.  (Note: 'squarea' is
      short for 'squared area' and is only used in the test filenames.)
    * tc-squaredarea.php: New test for squaredarea plot with transparency and
      area overlap.
    * tc-area2.php: New test for area plot with transparency. This is the
      same as tc-squaredarea.php except for the plot type and title, and
      allows for comparing these two plot types with the same data.
    * ex-squaredarea1.php, ex-stackedsquaredarea1.php: New, examples which
      will be in the reference manual.

    Updated tests for new 'squaredarea' and 'stackedsquaredarea' plot types:
    * matchtypes.php: Expanded the test to cover these 2 new plot types, and
      also horizontal bars vs stackedbars.
      Added option to save the plots to files, for debugging.
    * u.ptdt.php: Add new plot types to plot type/data type matrix.
    * u.baddata.php: Added 12 cases for new types + 2 cases for existing.
    * empty-nocols-sqa.php, empty-nocols-ssq.php: New cases of empty-nocols.
    * empty-plot-sqa.php, empty-plot-ssq.php: New cases of empty-plot.

    * tests.ini: List 30 new tests.
    * empty-nocols-sq.php: Fix typo

2015-10-23
    Expanded and renamed unit test of label format types.
    * fmtlab-printf3.php: Renamed to u.formattype.php
    * u.formattype.php: Renamed from fmtlab-printf3.php. Extended to test
      more format types, and added all examples from the reference manual
      SetXLabelType page. (Several of these turned out to be wrong.)
    * tests.ini: Renamed 1 test.
    
2015-10-22
    New tests for multi-format printf in label formatting (FR#56).
    * labelformats[789].php: New tests for 1, 2, and 3 format strings.
    * fmtlab-printf3.php: New unit test.
    * tests.ini: List 4 new tests.

2015-10-16
    A pair of new tests that came out of taking a closer look at area fill
    plot types.
    * area2.php: New test, area plot fill overlaps with transparency.
    * matchtypes.php: New test checks that area and stackedarea (also bars
      and stackedbars) make the same plot when there is a single data set.
    * tests.ini: List 2 new tests.
    * README: fixed a missing parenthesis in a code sample.

2015-08-31
    * labelprec*.php: 4 new (actually from 2013) tests for label precision.
    * tests.ini: List 4 new tests.
    * run_test.php: Fix format in summary.
    * compare_tests.php: Check for and report removed tests, clean up output.

2015-08-29
    Fixes needed for PHP-7.0 (not yet released):
    * callback2.php: Class name as constructor raises DEPRECATED warning.
      Fixed when calling parent constructor too.
    * imagemap_unit-pi-tds.php: Fixed duplicate parameter $unused.

2015-03-20
    * testversion.php: Fix for fix made 2013-11-13 below to accept phpdoc tag
      for version. Despite a comment saying it checked the top 25 lines of
      the file, it only checked 10, which wasn't enough.

2013-11-13
    * missing.php: Add support to this test for horizontal plots, which
      were not being tested for missing point behavior.
    * missingh*.php: 10 new tests for missing points in horizontal plots.
    * tests.ini: List 10 new tests.

    * testversion.php: Fix to also work with under-development PHPlot which
      uses phpdoc comments. (This test checks the source code for a version
      string in a comment; the new code uses a phpdoc tag for that. The
      test now works with both.)

2013-05-10
    * compare_tests.php: Updated this utility script which compares test
      results against a baseline. Added text file compare, -q option for
      quieter operation, and -m option to check only matched tests.

2013-05-07
    * transparent-reset*.php: 2 tests that were overlooked (written but never
      added to the test suite for PHPlot-6.0.0). They test the fix/feature for
      resetting transparent color selection.
    * tests.ini: List 2 new tests.

2013-04-26
    * dtaliases.php, range-log[1-5].php: Fix top comments (these are
      extracted by a script used to help keep track of the tests).

2013-04-25
    Added new tests for making imagemaps from the new box plots:
    * imagemap_html-bx.php, imagemap_trace-bx.php: 2 new tests
    * tests.ini: List 2 new tests.
    Changed test for new plot type:
    * u.baddata.php: Add test cases for new box plots.

2013-04-23
    Added new tests for Box Plots (feature request #52):
    * ex-boxplot[12].php: New box plot examples from reference manual.
    * boxplot*.php: 11 new tests for box plots.
    * tests.ini: List 13 new tests.
    * u.ptdt.php: Expand to include the new plot type in the test cases.

2013-04-16
    Added new test to check the data type aliases in SetDataType() which
    was re-written for PHPlot-6.1.0.
    * dtaliases.php: New unit test.
    * tests.ini: 1 new test.

    Add new example from Reference Manual as a test:
    * ex-horizerror.php: New example from reference manual.
    * tests.ini: 1 new test.

2013-04-14
    Added new tests for horizontal error plots (feature request #47, for
    PHPlot-6.1.0).
    * horzerrplt*.php: New tests for horizontal error plots.
    * tests.ini: List 10 new tests.
    * u.ptdt.php: Expand to include the new data type in the test cases.

2013-04-02
    Fix 8 tests that failed to prove their point because of the change
    in default minticks from 5 to 8.
    * range-auto7bin[45].php, range-auto7dec4[a-f].php: Set minticks to 5
      (the old default) so the tests show the intended change in resulting
      tick increment at the thresholds.

2013-04-01
    More tests for auto-range/auto-tick calculations.
    * range-auto7date[1-5].php, range-auto8mt[4-9].php, range-autoii[1-3].php:
      New tests
    * tests.ini: List 14 new tests.

2013-03-26
    Added new tests for auto-range/auto-tick calculations (bugs #132, #101)
    which are the major new changes in PHPlot-6.0.0. Note: Each of these
    tests should either run under PHPlot-5.x, or else exit gracefully
    with 'skip' status if they need features added in PHPlot-6.0.0.
    * u.calcplotareaworld.php, u.calcstep.php: New unit tests for
      auto-range/auto-tick calculations.
    * fractionticks.php: Test fractional tick labels.
    * range-*.php, tickset*.php: New tests for auto-range/auto-tick
      calculations.
    * tests.ini: List 93 new tests.


    * legendtxbgcolor.php: Send 'test skipped' message to stdout not stderr.

2013-03-19
    Added new tests for bug #166 legend with point shapes vs shape 'none':
    * useshape-noshape*.php : 2 new tests
    * tests.ini: List 2 new tests.

2013-03-02
    Re-synchronize the tests named "ex-*" with the examples in the PHPlot
    Reference Manual. These tests started out as copies of the examples,
    but as the manual is updated sometimes the examples have to change.
    * tests.ini: List 1 new test
    * ex-legendshape.php: extended test to support variable plot type.
    * ex-legendshape2.php: new test, variation of legend shapes for line plot.
    * ex-ohlcbasic.php, ex-ohlccandlesticks.php, ex-ohlccandlesticks2.php: Use
      new tuning function to suppress scaling the Y axis to include zero,
      which improves the appearance of these plots.
    * ex-ytickanchor.php: Force the plot range, to demonstrate the need for
      a Y tick anchor. Starting with PHPlot-6.0.0, the default behavior was
      such that this example no longer showed the problem, before this fix.

2013-02-11
    * config.php: Fix font name issues on Windows. The default option
      still uses the DejaVu font family on all systems. (This font is included
      with LibreOffice.) A flag can be set which will use standard Windows
      fonts instead, however it will be much harder to verify results.

2013-02-03
    * u.FindDataLimits.php: At SVN rev 1502 on the /Rel6 branch, this test
      broke because PHPlot now sets the min/max limits for implied range
      (text-data) more accurately up front, rather than fixing them later.
      Changed expected test results for all text-data cases to match the
      new behavior, and added a function which will adjust the expected
      results when the test is run with older versions of PHPlot. (Note:
      the detection code is imperfect and the fix will not work for some
      SVN revs before 1502 and after the Rel6 branch.)

2013-01-17
    * LICENSES: Update copyright year, no change to licenses.
    Added new tests for legend background & text color control:
    * legendtxbgcolor*.php : 4 new tests for SetLegendBgColor() and
      SetLegendTextColor().
    * tests.ini: List 4 new tests.

2012-12-29
    * run_test.php: Implemented 'skipped' tests, using exit(2).
    * README: Updated to describe new 'skip test' exit status.
    * drawdataborder.php, ex-horizlinepts.php, ex-pieangle.php,
      legendcolorboxborder.php, piebcol.php, ydatalabellines.php: Skip tests
      if required new method(s) are missing.
    * drawtextfont.php, horzlpe.php: Skip test based on PHPlot version.

2012-12-27
    * testversion.php: Removed obsolete check for "CVS" string in version,
      and added check for new version_id constant.

2012-12-24
    * legshape2.php: This test 'broke' with recent code changes. It was
      supposed to show SetLegendUseShapes(True) being ignored for a plot
      type (lines) that did not support shape markers, but PHPlot does now
      support that function with line plots. Changed the plot type to
      'thinbarline', and updated the title.

2012-12-23
    Added new tests for feature requests #50 and #51:
    * drawdataborder*.php : 8 new tests for SetDrawDataBorders()
    * legendcolorboxborder*.php : 4 new tests for SetLegendColorboxBorders()
    * legendlinemarker*.php : 15 new tests for line markers in legend
    * tests.ini: List 27 new tests.

2012-09-23
    Added 3 new tests for bug #164 (previously #3557510) "Calculated
    defaults applied to subsequent plots".
    * multidefault-labelfmt*.php : 3 new tests.
    * tests.ini: List 3 new tests.

2012-09-18
    Added 23 new tests for feature request #47 "Extend horizontal plots to
    more types":
    * ex-horizlinepts.php: New example from reference manual
    * horzlpe*.php: 15 new tests for horizontal lines/points
    * ydatalabellines*.php: 7 new tests for Y data label lines
    * tests.ini: List 23 new tests. Total now is 859 tests.
    These test changes were needed because of the feature request:
    * u.ptdt.php: Changed expected results, since 3 plottypes now accept
      2 more data types each (6 cases now expected to work).
    * dlexformat3[abc].php: Removed flag saying data value labels won't be
      produced, since data-data-error plots can now display them.
    * dlexformat.php: For data-data-error plots, set the data value label
      angle, so the labels aren't on top of the error bars.

2012-09-23
    Added 6 new tests for feature request #46 "Control pie chart borders":
    * piebcol*.php: 6 new tests
    * tests.ini: List 6 new tests. Total now is 836 tests.

2012-09-10
    Added 8 new tests for bug #165 "Missing axis labels on some empty plots":
    * empty-nocols*.php : 8 new tests
    * tests.ini: List 8 new tests

2012-08-20
    Added 6 new tests. These are related to bug #3557510 "Calculated defaults
    applied to subsequent plots". Details:
    * multidefault-axis[12].php: Calculated default axis position sticks to
      next plot (1), unless reset (2). Documented behavior, not a bug.
    * multidefault-labelgrid[12].php: Calculated label position and grid
      on/off stick to next plot (1). Grid part is a bug, to be fixed in
      PHPlot-6.0.0. Label position is not yet determined to be a bug. In
      (2) the label positions are reset.
    * multidefault-labelangle1.php: X data label angle defaults to X label
      angle, but sticks even if X label angle changes. Will be fixed in 6.0.0.
    * multidefault-tickinc1.php: Tick increment needs to be calculated again
      for each plot. PHPlot-5.8.0 does this right. 6.0.0 in development was
      broken for a while, but now does it right too.

2012-08-14
    Fixed multiple tests that broke with an upcoming change for PHPlot-6.0.0
    which makes most class variables protected visibility. In most cases,
    the fix was to use a new class which extends PHPlot and allows access
    to the needed variable(s).  No changes to test output.
    * colors.php: Allow access to $rgb_array.
    * defaultfont1a.php, defaultfont2a.php: Allow access to $default_ttfont.
    * linepoints1.php: Allow access to $point_shapes.
    * stream2.php: Allow access to $stream_frame_header, $stream_boundary.
    * u.FindDataLimits: Allow access to internal methods CheckDataArray()
      and FindDataLimits(), and to the 4 min/max x/y variables.
    * u.dvlpos.php: Make a new object for each case, instead of reusing it
      and doing unset() on the tuning variables.  Also, removed compatibility
      code for PHPlot-5.7.0 and older. The test now requires 5.8.0 or higher.
    * u.pmarg.php: Allow access to $plot_area.
    * u.setcolors.php: Allow access to $default_colors, $data_colors,
      $data_border_colors, $error_bar_colors.

2012-08-03
    * u.tickanchor.php: Fixed test failure on new "Rel6" branch code, due
      to internal changes, by going through to DrawGraph() before fetching
      the tick values. No changes to test output.
      Also fixed typo (unreachable return).
    * drawtextfont.php: Fix typo in variable name. No changes to test.
    * overlay3.php: Need to turn off Y grid before second plot, else it
      draws over the grid a second time which may or may not change the
      plot appearance.
    * resets3.php: Add a comment explaining the odd values on the Y axis of
      the lower plot, after settings are reset from the top plot.

2012-07-27
    New tests for release 6.0.0 changes to SetPlotAreaWorld() range checking:
    * error-SetPlotAreaWorld*.php : 10 new tests
    * tests.ini: List 10 new tests.

2012-07-26
    * misc-a1.php: Removed incorrect comment about color definition, and
      removed unneeded colors from the map. This goes along with corrections
      made to the reference manual for SetRGBArray() on 2012-06-12 in the
      "Rel6" branch for release 6.0.0. (It is not necessary to define
      PHPlot's internally-used colors in the custom color map.)
      No change to test output.
    * misc-a2.php: New test for error detection in SetRGBArray().
      Note: This test fails (does not detect the error) before PHPlot-6.0.0.
    * ex-pieangle.php: New test from new reference manual example showing
      pie chart start angle and direction setting.
      Note: This test fails before PHPlot-6.0.0.
    * drawtextfont.php: New test of font argument extension in DrawText().
      Note: This test fails before PHPlot-6.0.0.
    * tests.ini: List 3 new tests.

2012-04-26
    * run_test.php: Track and report test "N of M"; report total elapsed time
      at end, and add -match command line option for selecting tests.

2012-04-06
    * serialize1.php : New test for serialize/unserialize
    * tests.ini: List 1 new test.

2012-04-01
    * stream1.php, stream2.php : 2 new tests for streaming plots.
    * tests.ini: List 2 new tests. Total is now 802 tests.

2012-03-24
    * dlexformat*.php: 19 new tests for custom label formatting with
      row and column arguments.
    * ex-dlexformat.php : 1 new test from new reference manual example.
    * tests.ini: List 20 new tests
    * makedata.php: New support script, used by new tests.
    * Makefile: List new support script

    * u.dvlpos.php: Fix test which broke due to new usage of
      CheckDataValueLabels().  Changed to auto-detect old or new usage
      and now works with both.

2012-03-19
    * datalabellines.php: Add support for error plots.
    * datalabellines[cde].php: 3 new tests, data label lines in error plots.
    * tests.ini: List 3 new tests

    * imagemap_html-{b,bu,c,pi,pt}.php: Fix the test output messages so they
      do not contain the path to the results directory, to avoid spurious
      result compare errors.

2012-03-16
    * datalabellines.php: Add support for testing data label lines with
      bubble plots (reference: bug #3506408).
    * datalabellines[9ab].php: 3 new tests, data label lines in bubble plots.
    * tests.ini: List 3 new tests

2012-02-24
    * histogram.php: Resync to example in manual: 1 comment typo fixed, use
      SetDraw[XY]Axis to disable axis lines rather than changing them to
      transparent (which was the only way to do this at the time), and fix
      for no border if draw_border is off. These changes have no effect
      on the test output files.

2012-02-21
    * imagemap_html-*.php: 12 new tests for imagemaps. These produce HTML.
    * imagemap_trace-*.php: 10 new tests for imagemaps. These produce images.
    * imagemap_unit-*.php: 4 new tests for imagemaps. These are unit tests.
    * tests.ini: List 26 new tests for imagemaps

2012-02-18
    * labelcolor*.php, pielabelcolor*.php: New tests for new functions to
      set label colors.
    * tests.ini: List 9 new tests

    * compare_tests.php: Fix typo in script, error with bad command option.

2012-02-17
    * ex-drawmessage.php: Test fails on Windows due to font file not found.
      Fixed to use the config.php file and font name variables for more
      system independence.
    * localepielabel.php: New test for pie label format bug with locale
      using , for decimal point.
    * tests.ini: List new test

2012-02-06
    * drawmessage*.php: Added 8 new tests for DrawMessage()
    * ex-drawmessage.php: Added 1 new test from Reference Manual example
      of DrawMessage().
    * tests.ini: List 9 new tests

2012-01-09
    * backgroundreset*.php: Added 4 new tests. These are actually old tests,
      from 2010-12-26 work on resetting the background with multiple plots
      on an image, but they never got added to the test suite.
    * tests.ini: List 4 new tests

2012-01-02
    * ex-pielabeltype: Resync to example from the manual. This removes two
      data rows which were too small to display.

2012-01-01
    * LICENSES: Update copyright year, no change to licenses.

2011-12-30
    Add 70 new tests and 1 data file, for the pie sizing and label changes.
    * ex-pielabeltype*.php: New example files and data file, from the manual.
    * multipie.php, pieautosize*.php, pieminautosize*.php, pieminsize*.php,
      piesize*.php: New tests for pie sizing and label types.
    * Makefile: List new dependent file
    * tests.ini: Add 70 new tests to run

2011-12-21
    * multiplot.php: Added option for plot-area-relative legend positioning,
      to fix the test failure in multiplot2 with new pie chart code.
    * multiplot2.php: Use new plot-area-relative legend positioning, not world
      coordinates. This fixes a test failure with the new pie chart code,
      which does not set up world coordinate mapping with pie charts. World
      coordinates don't make sense for pie charts and this should not have
      worked before.

2011-12-10
    * LICENSES: Fix typo, no change to licenses.

2011-08-24
    * tests.ini: Fix validation pattern for encodeimg1 per previous change.

2011-08-19
    * encodeimg1.php: Fix message from test so it does not contain the path
      to the results directory, to avoid spurious result compare errors.

2011-08-08
    * The PHPlot Test Suite is imported into SubVersion. No prior change
      history is available here (although the test suite development goes
      back to 2006).
