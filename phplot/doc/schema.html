<h2>The Drawing</h2>
<p>
The drawing you can see here is an attempt to illustrate the positioning
of elements on the canvas of PHPlot graphs. I'm not specially good at it
so please don't complain. I (<a href="nonick AT 8027 DOT org">Miguel</a>)
hope it will help somebody as it did with me when I first began browsing
through the 3000 lines of code Afan had written.

<p>If you are curious, for the drawing I used 
<a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia/">Dia</a> a gtk+ diagram creation
sofware which I find easy and suited for my purposes.

<h2>The words</h2>
<p> Creating a graph with PHPlot is easy, you just create an instance of
the class, set up a few options, push in the data and smile with your
new cute graphic. However here we'll proceed a little more step by step so
to show you how to get the most of PHPlot.
