<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>Many web sites need to create real-time or dynamic charts and graphs.
from live data sets. Many users have found PHP a great way for this dynamic
creation of images using the GD library and there have been several
good articles describing this [] [] []. The advantage of using the server
to create an image (server side scripting) is that one does not have to 
worry about browser compatibility or client operating system compatibility issues.
The PHP image generating library uses the GD library to create elementary
shapes (elipse, line, rectangle, ...).  
PHPlot is a graphics library which provides a means by which you can have your
(PHP enabled) web server create and manipulate graphs as objects and
display the completed graph as an image. Data sets passed to PHPlot use a very 
convenient way for database driven sites, in rows with y coordinate data.
</p>

<p>First, lets discuss how PHPlot works in general with some
terminology. A PHPlot <i>image </i>can consist of several <i>graphs </i>,
each graph consisting of several <i>elements</i>.
You define an object (e.g. a variable like <code>$graph</code>),
select the properties of the element that compose the graph and "<i>Draw</i>"
what you want into the object. Tipically by selecting the plot type with
<code>SetPlotType</code> and at the end calling <code>DrawGraph</code>. You
can also directly invoke <code>PrintImage</code>, which either inserts the image
into the data streaming to the client or writes it to disk. 
</p>
<p>In PHPlot there are <em>World coordinates</em>, which are the XY coordinates 
relative to the axis origin, in the units of the data set; and 
<em>device (pixel)</em> coordinates which in GD are relative to the 
origin at the upper left side of the image. 
</p>
<p>You can think of the "Draw" functions as shaping the
image object and the "Print" function as the method of
finally creating the digital image. PHPlot is smart enough that if
you only have one graph on an image, then the "Print" is
done for you automatically. If you do have multiple graphs per image
then you'll need to use both the "Draw" and "Print"
functions. We'll talk about that a bit later. 
</p>
<p>Since PHP is a server scripted language you have several options
for how you can "Print" the image. You can:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Write the image as a file on the server. (You specify a file
	name and can specify caching as well)</li>
	<li>Have the raw data stream out within an HTML file, as &lt;IMG
	SRC="my_PHPlot_code.php"&gt;</li>
	<li>Precede the raw data with html image headers and call the
	script directly (showing up as an image) e.g.
	http://somewhere/my_PHPlot_code2.php .</li>
</ol>
<p>This document explains how to create plots using PHPlot from a
PHP script. Information on PHP can be found at <a href="http://www.php.net/">www.php.net</a>.
Information about the GD library which PHP uses to create images can
be found at <a href="http://www.boutell.com/">www.boutell.com</a>.
More information about PHPlot can be found at <a href="www.phplot.com">www.PHPlot.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Creating the Object</h2>

<p>You create a PHPlot object by first including the code to be used
and then defining the variable:</p>
<table class="box">
  <tr>
    <td>
	  <pre>&lt;?php
include('./phplot.php');  // here we include the PHPlot code 
$graph = new PHPlot();   // here we define the variable graph 

//Rest of code goes below
?&gt;</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The above code assigns the PHPlot object to the variable <code>$graph</code>.</p>
<p>Now we have created a PHPlot graph object, we can access
information about the object and manipulate the object. In these
following examples, <code>$graph</code> is the variable/object we created
above.</p>

<p> <a href="#top">Back to top</a> </p>


<h2>Real World Examples</h2>
<h3><a name="first"></a>Case 1: A simple graph</h3>

<p>We will start with a simple line graph. </p>
<table class="box">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>&lt;?php
//Include the code
include('./PHPlot.php');

//Define the object
$graph = new PHPlot();

//Define some data
$example_data = array(
     array('a',3),
     array('b',5),
     array('c',7),
     array('d',8),
     array('e',2),
     array('f',6),
     array('g',7)
);
$graph-&gt;SetDataValues($example_data);

//Draw it
$graph-&gt;DrawGraph(); // remember, since in this example we have one graph, PHPlot 
                        // does the <i>PrintImage </i>part for you 
?&gt;</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p> And that's it! What we get is the following graph: </p>
<div align=center>
  <img src="imgs/qstart_fig1.png" name="fig1" alt="figure 1" align="bottom" border="0">
  <br />Figure 1
</div>
<p>That's a great
start, but now we'd like to specify the width and height of the
image. 
</p>

<h3>Case 1a: Different Size Images and Titles</h3>
<p>
Lets say we want it to have a width of 300 and a height of 250 pixels.
So instead of having the line <br /><br />
    <code>$graph = new PHPlot();</code> <br /><br />
we replace it with <br /><br />
    <code>$graph = new PHPlot(300,250);</code><br /><br />
and you have specified the size in pixels of the image to be created.
A couple of things to note:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The default is <em>not </em> to use TTF fonts. </li>
  <li>Since there was only one graph on the image we didn't have to
	specify PrintImage, DrawGraph took care of it for us. 
  </li>
  <li>
	We did not specify the data type. If you do not specify the data
	type PHPlot assumes <code>text-data</code>. 
  </li>
  <li>
	We did not specify the file type (gif, png, jpg, ...) .
	As of PHPlot 4.4.3 PHPlot assumes PNG image formats. 
  </li>
  <li>
	The data is passed in as an array of arrays. This may seem awkward
	now, but as we add functionality this will be beneficial. 
  </li> 
</ul>
<p>Ok, now we're ready to add some customization to the plot. Let's change
the size, the title and the x/y axis labels. All we need to do is modify 
the variable <code>$graph</code> before printing the image. We achieve this with:
</p>
<table class="box">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>&lt;?php            
include ('./phplot.php');

//create an graph object 300x250 pixels
$graph = new PHPlot(300,250); 
//Set titles
$graph-&gt;SetTitle("Title\n\rSubtitle");
$graph-&gt;SetXTitle('X data');
$graph-&gt;SetYTitle('Y data');

//...rest of code


?&gt;</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align=center>
 <img src="imgs/qstart_fig2.png" name="graphic1" align="bottom" border="0"><br />
 Figure 2 
</p>
<p>Note that in order for the "\n"
and "\r " to be interpreted as new line/new return
characters for <i>SetTitle </i>you have to enclose the string in
<b>double </b>quotes. 
</p>

<h3><a name="lines"></a>Case 2: Multiple Lines per Graph </h3>
<p>Lets say we want to plot not just one
dataset but several y values for each x position. With PHPlot it is
easy to specify the multiple data lines by just passing in all the Y
values for a given X value at once. So instead of array('label', y)
we specify array('label', y<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>3</sub>,
...) 
<br />
Now our data will have three Y values for each position on the X axis
</p>
<table class="box">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>&lt;?php
//Include the code
include('./phplot.php');

//Define the object
$graph = new PHPlot(300,250);

//Set titles
$graph-&gt;SetTitle("Title\n\rSubtitle");
$graph-&gt;SetXTitle('X data');
$graph-&gt;SetYTitle('Y data');


//Define some data
$example_data = array(
     array('a',3,4,2),
     array('b',5,'',1),  // here we have a missing data point, that's ok
     array('c',7,2,6),
     array('d',8,1,4),
     array('e',2,4,6),
     array('f',6,4,5),
     array('g',7,2,3)
);
$graph-&gt;SetDataValues($example_data);

//Draw it
$graph-&gt;DrawGraph();
?&gt;</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Which gives us: </p>
<p align=center><img src="imgs/qstart_fig3.png" name="graphic2" align=bottom border="0"><br />Figure 3</p>
<p>Notice that each set of Y data gets a different color.
Also the missing data point is skipped, this behaviour can be adjusted with
<code>SetDrawBrokenLines(TRUE);</code>
</p>
<p>This gives you the basics of how to
create a graph in PHPlot. A nice start, but now we'd like to add some
customization, namely different fonts, margins and types of graphs. 
</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a> </p>


<h3>Customization</h3>
<p>Valid types of plots ( as of PHPlot 4.4.6) </p>
<ul>
	<li>bars</li>
	<li>lines</li>
	<li>linepoints (a faster way of plotting when you want both points and lines)</li>
	<li>area</li> 
	<li>points</li>
	<li>pie</li>
	<li>thinbarline (sometimes also called impulse) </li>
	<li>error bar (which can also be used for stock market data graphs)</li>
    <li>squared (for binary data) </li>
</ul>
<p>You specify which type with the <code>SetPlotType</code> function.
We'll look at that command with bars and lines in the next example when we look at
multiple graphs per image. 
</p>
<p>As we discussed before, there are several ways we can manipulate
the look/feel of the graph object. As we go further we will introduce
some of these types in addition to some of
the more advanced features of PHPlot. For more specialized examples
and a complete list of functions see <a href="www.phplot.com">www.PHPlot.com</a>
or look in the examples directory that came with PHPlot.
</p>

<h3><a name="multiple"></a> <b>Case 3: Multiple Graphs per Image </b></h3>

<p>To create an image with several separate graphs
on it is a straightforward process. As in the previous examples we
first have to create an object (e.g. variable) but now we tell it to
<i>not</i> print the image at the same time as the draw command. Now
we want it to wait for the explicit <code>PrintImage</code> function call. 
To tell PHPlot this is the way we want to work, we use the
<code>SetPrintImage</code> function.
<code>SetPrintImage(TRUE)</code> is the default, and tells to draw the image
when <code>DrawGraph</code> is called. To turn this
off we use <code>SetPrintImage(FALSE)</code>.</p>
<p>Now we will draw several images entirely within one object. That
means that if we set a value for one graph, there will be a couple of
other commands we will need. 
</p>
<p>To specify in pixels the placement of each graph we use
<code>SetNewPlotAreaPixels</code>. The format is
<code>SetNewPlotAreaPixels(upper_left_x, upper_left_y, lower_right_x,
lower_right_y)</code> . Again we are using the GD coordinates where 0,0
is the upper left corner of the image. 
</p>
<p>In more detail:</p>
<table class="box">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>&lt;?php
include('./PHPlot.php');  // here we include the PHPlot code 
$graph = new PHPlot(400,250);   // here we define the variable $graph 
$graph-&gt;SetPrintImage(0); //Don't draw the image yet

//....Data and Values for first graph here .....

$graph-&gt;SetNewPlotAreaPixels(70,10,375,100);  // where to place it

$graph-&gt;DrawGraph();   //Draw the first graph to the image. 

//....Data and Values for second graph here .....

$graph-&gt;SetNewPlotAreaPixels(70,120,375,220); //where to place graph 2
$graph-&gt;DrawGraph();  //Draw the second graph to the image

//Print the image with both graphs
$graph-&gt;PrintImage();
?&gt;</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Lets now create an image with 2 graphs on it with some example data.  </p>

<table class="box">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre>&lt;?php
//Include the code
include('./phplot.php');

//Define the object
$graph = new PHPlot(400,250);

$graph-&gt;SetPrintImage(0); //Don't draw the image until specified explicitly

$example_data = array(
     array('a',3),
     array('b',5),
     array('c',7),
     array('d',8),
     array('e',2),
     array('f',6),
     array('g',7)
);

$graph-&gt;SetDataType("text-data");  //Must be called before SetDataValues

$graph-&gt;SetDataValues($example_data);
$graph-&gt;SetYTickIncrement(2);  //a smaller graph now - so we set a new tick increment

$graph-&gt;SetXLabelAngle(90);
$graph-&gt;SetXTitle("");
$graph-&gt;SetYTitle("Price");
$graph-&gt;SetPlotType("lines");
$graph-&gt;SetLineWidth(1);

$graph-&gt;SetNewPlotAreaPixels(70,10,375,100);  // where do we want the graph to go
$graph-&gt;DrawGraph(); // remember, since we said not to draw yet, PHPlot 
                     // still needs a <i>PrintImage </i>command to write an image.</pre>
<p><br /></p>                     
<pre>//Now do the second chart on the same image
unset($example_data);  //we are re-using $example_data (to save memory), but you don't have to
$example_data = array(
     array('a',30,40,20),
     array('b',50,'',10),  // here we have a missing data point, that's ok
     array('c',70,20,60),
     array('d',80,10,40),
     array('e',20,40,60),
     array('f',60,40,50),
     array('g',70,20,30)
);

$graph-&gt;SetDataType("text-data");  //Must be called before SetDataValues

$graph-&gt;SetDataValues($example_data);

$graph-&gt;SetXTitle("");
$graph-&gt;SetYTitle("Verbal Cues");
$graph-&gt;SetYTickIncrement(10);
$graph-&gt;SetPlotType("bars");
$graph-&gt;SetXLabelAngle(0);  //have to re-set as defined above

$graph-&gt;SetNewPlotAreaPixels(70,120,375,220);
$graph-&gt;SetPlotAreaWorld(0,0,7,80);
$graph-&gt;DrawGraph();

//Print the image
$graph-&gt;PrintImage();
?&gt;</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
<br />
<br />
Which gives us: </p>
<p align="center">
<img src="imgs/qstart_fig4.png" name="graphic3" align="top" border="0" />
<br />
Figure 4<br />
<p>You must remember that world Coordinates are the XY coordinates relative to the
axis origin that can be drawn. Not the device (pixel) coordinates
which in GD are relative to the origin at the upper left
side of the image.
