OVERVIEW:

PHPlot is a PHP class for creating scientific and business charts.

The release documentation contains only summary information. For more
complete information, download the PHPlot Reference Manual from the
Sourceforge project web site. You can also view the manual online at
http://phplot.sourceforge.net

For important changes in this release, see the NEWS.txt file.

REQUIREMENTS:

You need a recent version of PHP5, and you are advised to use the latest
stable release.  This version of PHPlot has been tested with PHP-5.3.3 and
PHP-5.2.14 on Linux, and with PHP-5.3.3 on Windows/XP.

Use of PHP-5.3.2 or PHP-5.2.13 is not recommended, if you are using
TrueType Font (TTF) text. A bug with TTF rendering in those versions
affects PHPlot images. This was fixed in PHP-5.3.3 and PHP-5.2.14.

You need the GD extension to PHP either built in to PHP or loaded as a
module. Refer to the PHP documentation for more information - see the
Image Functions chapter in the PHP Manual. We test PHPlot only with the
PHP-supported, bundled GD library.

If you want to display PHPlot charts on a web site, you need a PHP-enabled
web server. You can also use the PHP CLI interface without a web server.

PHPlot supports TrueType fonts, but does not include any TrueType font
files.  If you want to use TrueType fonts on your charts, you need to have
TrueType support in GD, and some TrueType font files.  By default, PHPlot
uses a simple font which is built in to the GD library.


INSTALLATION:

Unpack the distribution. (If you are reading this file, you have probably
already done that.)

Installation of PHPlot simply involves copying two script files somewhere
your PHP application scripts will be able to find them. The scripts are:
     phplot.php   - The main script file
     rgb.inc.php  - Optional large color table
Make sure the permissions on these files allow the web server to read them.

The ideal place is a directory outside your web server document area,
and on your PHP include path. You can add to the include path in the PHP
configuration file; consult the PHP manual for details.


KNOWN ISSUES:

Here are some of the problems we know about in PHPlot. See the bug tracker
on the PHPlot project web site for more information.

#1795969 The automatic range calculation for Y values needs to be rewritten.  
  This is especially a problem with small offset ranges (e.g. Y=[999:1001]).
  You can use SetPlotAreaWorld to set a specific range instead.

#1605558 Wide/Custom dashed lines don't work well
  This is partially a GD issue, partially PHPlot's fault.

#2919086 Improve tick interval calculations
  Tick interval calculations should try for intervals of 1, 2, or 5 times
  a power of 10.

PHP Issues:

  PHP has many build-time and configuration options, and these can affect
the operation of PHPlot (as well as any other application or library). Here
are some known issues:
  + Slackware Linux includes a version of PHP built with --enable-gd-jis-conv
(JIS-mapped Japanese font support). This prevents the usual UTF-8 encoding
of characters from working in TrueType Font (TTF) text strings.
  + The Ubuntu Linux PHP GD package (php5-gd) was built to use the external
shared GD library, not the one bundled with PHP. This can result in small
differences in images, and some unsupported features (such as advanced
truecolor image operations). Also, although this Ubuntu GD library was
built with fontconfig support, PHP does not use it, so you still need to
specify TrueType fonts with their actual file names.
  + Some PHP installations may have a memory limit set too low to support
large images, especially truecolor images.


If you think you found a problem with PHPlot, or want to ask questions or
provide feedback, please use the Help and Discussion forum at
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplot/
If you are sure you have found a bug, you can report it on the Bug tracker
at the same web site. There is also a Features Request tracker.


TESTING:

You can test your installation by creating the following two files somewhere
in your web document area. First, the HTML file:

------------ simpleplot.html ----------------------------
<html>
<head>
<title>Hello, PHPlot!</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>PHPlot Test</h1>
<img src="simpleplot.php">
</body>
</html>
---------------------------------------------------------

Second, in the same directory, the image file producing PHP script file.
Depending on where you installed phplot.php, you may need to specify a path
in the 'require' line below.

------------ simpleplot.php -----------------------------
<?php
require 'phplot.php';
$plot = new PHPlot();
$data = array(array('', 0, 0), array('', 1, 9));
$plot->SetDataValues($data);
$plot->SetDataType('data-data');
$plot->DrawGraph();
---------------------------------------------------------

Access the URL to 'simpleplot.html' in your web browser. If you see a
simple graph, you have successfully installed PHPlot. If you see no
graph, check your web server error log for more information.
