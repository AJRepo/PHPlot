This is a class for creating scientific and business charts. 
To start extract the files with

	tar -zxvf phplot-5.0rc1.tar.gz 
    
and then point your browser to 

	doc/index.php.

There are some configuration settings that you will need to make 
based on your setup. 

1. File Type: Depending on the version of GD you are using, 
   you may or may not have GIF or PNG file ability. That is 
   set with the function. 
   
        SetFileFormat("<filetype>") where <filetype> is png, gif, jpeg, ...
        
   or edit the file phplot.php and change the line
   
        var $file_format = "<filetype>";

2. TTF: If you have TTF installed then use (and read the docs)

        SetUseTTF(TRUE);
        
   otherwise use
   
	SetUseTTF(FALSE);

Everything else should be independent of what version you are using.
This has been tested with PHP3, PHP4, GD1.2 and GD 3.8. 

To start please see doc/index.php. There you'll find examples, tests and
some introductory documents.
