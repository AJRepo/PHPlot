    * Allow SetLegendStyle colorbox_align argument to be 'none', to suppress
      the colorboxes in the legend.

      Fix comment on $legend_text_align: empty means right, not left.

      Rewrote DrawLegend layout code to make it easier to understand. The
      result should be within 1 or 2 pixels of the previous size and position.

2007-08-04 (lbayuk)
    * New feature: control legend text and color box alignment.
      Adds a new function SetLegendStyle to adjust the alignment of the
      text and the color boxes inside the legend.
      Based on part of bug 1208054, contributed by David Hernández Sanz.

2006-12-02 (lbayuk)
    * Fixes for bug 1605555: Y Data Labels use wrong font and not formatted.
      Use y_label_font (not x_label_font) for Y Data Labels.
      Use the formatted value for the label, not the original text.
      (This applies to bar charts only, with the new Y data labels.)

    * One fix for bug 1208054: Localization of number format.
      If number formatting is enabled with 'data' format type, PHPlot previously
      used dot for decimal point and comma for thousands separator, and there
      was no way to change it.
      
      This fix adds a new function:
               SetNumberFormat($decimal_point, $thousands_separator)
      to set the separators.  In addition, if that function is not used,
      PHPlot will now try to use locale-dependent separators. If locale
      information is not available, it will fall back to the old defaults
      of dot and comma.

      Note: This change may have some negative effects. 1) If your locale is
      "C" or "Posix", you might not get a thousands separator now by default.
      You should be using a more specific locale. 2) If your PHP script is
      forcing a specific locale with setlocale(), PHPlot will probaby undo
      that because it uses setlocale(LC_ALL, '') to import locale information
      from the environment.  We have to do that, or a locale set through
      the environment is ignored. But it will override a manually set locale.

    * Fix for bug 937944: X/Y Tick Counts
      PHPlot could draw one too few Y tick marks, and one too many X tick marks.

      Changed the code to stop drawing X (Y) tick marks when the current X (Y)
      value exceeds the maximum X (Y) value plus a small fudge factor. The fudge
      factor accounts for cumulative error when repeatedly adding a delta to
      the X (Y) value.

      Notes: The bug report was writting about Y tick counts only, but X tick
      counts can also be wrong. The proposed fix in the bug report does not
      work in all cases.

      This fix changes the appearance of many plots which were missing the
      top-most Y tick mark. The extra X-tick mark problem is less common.

===== Released as 5.0rc3 =====

    * Fix for bug 1437912: x-axis label misalignment [bar charts]
      The calculations were redone from scratch.
      New control variable 'bar_extra_space', which works in addition to
      'group_frac_width' to control how much extra space is around the bars.
      Made bar widths match for 'stackedbars' and 1-bar-per-group 'bars'.

      NOTE: This changes the appearance of charts. bars in 'stackedbars'
      will now be thinner, and bars in 'bars' graphs will be thicker. I
      saw no reason for them being different before.

      This fix required fixing the positioning on the new bar data labels,
      which was off before.  The bar data labels will now be centered.
      Additional fixes to bar chart data labels:
         For negative values, the label will center under the bar.
         Fixed X-adjustment to account for shading.
         Fixed to not suppress the data label if the value is 0.


2006-11-10 (lbayuk)
    * Fix for bug 1594457: DrawError text wrap and background fix
      Do error image white background correctly, and word-wrap the text.

    * Fix for bug 1594458: Suppress lines or points in 'linepoints' 
      Don't draw X data labels twice for 'linepoints'.
      Allow SetPointShapes value 'none' to suppress points, and allow
      SetLineStyles value 'none' to suppress lines. This allows a 'linepoints'
      graph to mix lines only, points only, and both on the same graph.


2006-11-09 (lbayuk)
    * Fixes for bug 1446523:
      + Wrong variable name in deprecated SetAxisFontSize()
      + Fails to properly handle error if SetDataValues() was never
        called, or not called with a data array.

    * Fix for bug 1117122: Pie Chart ignores SetPlotAreaPixels
      Don't let DrawGraph recalculate the plot area for pie charts if the
      user already set it with SetPlotAreaPixels.

      NOTE: This fix may slightly change the appearance of some pie charts,
      whether or not they use SetPlotAreaPixels.

    * Fix for bug 1103992: Wrong max Y calculated for stackedbars
      Changes FindDataLimits to calculate max Y correctly. It was counting
      the first Y value in each record twice, which is always wrong but
      only affected stackedbars because the Y values are summed.

    * Fix for bug 1096199: Wrong error bar colors in DrawDotsError.
      Rewrites DrawDotsError to make it work like DrawLinesError to
      correctly increment the record and color indexes.
      Also fixes uninitialized x_now_pixels.

    * Fix for bug 1096197: No borders on unshaded Draw[Stacked]Bars
      Unshaded Bars and StackedBars covered the border with the rectangle.
      The fix is to draw the rectangle, then the border.

      NOTE: This fix changes chart appearance. Bars and Stacked Bars
      will now get a black border around each bar by default, if you
      turn off the 3D-shading. If you want borderless, unshaded bars
      you need to use SetDataBorderColors to set the data border colors
      to be the same as the data colors.

    * Fix for bug 1333164: Negative data values, if string variables, result
      in unfilled bars. The problem was a string-to-string compare of a
      negative number with the empty string x_axis_position. Fixed by
      initializing x_axis_y_pixels to 0 if SetXAxisPosition was not used.

2005-03-29 (afan)
    * Small typo fixed in SetYDataLabelPos

    * Update SetDataLabelPos: For past compatability we accept plotleft,
      ...but pass it to SetTickLabelPos

2005-03-26 (afan)
    * Change to line 3802: data lables now work with multiple bars with *$idx

2005-03-25 (afan)
