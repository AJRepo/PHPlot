manual, which only contains summaries of changes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2007-09-05
   * Change note on SetXLabelType for new behavior: ignoring blank labels.

2007-08-26
   * Document new option in SetLegendStyle: $colorbox_align = 'none'.

2007-08-04
   * Added documentation for new function SetLegendStyle.

2006-12-01
   * No changes, but regenerate the manual because the examples showed
     a change in tick/label counts at 5.0rc3 and this has been patched.

2006-11-29
   * Add new example bars4 showing bar chart data labels.
   * Fix notes comment at top of examples.xml: remove obsolete info on
     scaling of pictures for PDF output. Add notes on example order and
     referencing.

2006-11-28

   * Default 'time' format was fixed at 5.0rc3 as %H:%M:%S.
   * Found and fixed more references to "no Y data labels".

2006-11-27 Changes to catch up to 5.0rc3 release:

   * Update PHP version requirement. Min is 4.3.0 (not 4.2); PHP5 works; always
     use the latest versions.
   * Updated text to more closely match the release README file instructions,
     including ZIP file availability and no TrueType fonts included.
   * Delete note about "included examples and documentation", as they are no
     longer included in the release.

   * Changed 3 examples that use random data to seed the generator with a
     fixed value. So now the graphs won't change and file compares work.

   * Note how to get borderless, unshaded bars with SetDataBorderColors.

   * Document new values in SetPointShapes and SetLineStyles to suppress
     point markers or lines for individual datasets in 'linepoints' plots.
     (New feature in 5.0rc3)

   * Document new bar chart data labels with SetYDataLabelPos('plotin').

   * Add reference to another image viewer: qiv.

2006-09-24

   Reorganized. Reference section is now alphabetically by function,
   with the category grouping moved to a new chapter. This was done
   partly because the previous organization had some odd Table of
   Contents issues.

2006-05-20

   Conversion from SGML to XML, using DocBook-XML and the xsltproc
   processor.

2005-02-27 Released draft manual tagged REL20050227 dated 2005-02-27

2005-02-26

    Section 4.7 Reference, Fonts: TrueType font size issues
    * Don't scale the font figure for PDF; make it smaller so it fits
      on the page at full size. This is necessary so the fonts are
      shown sized to match the HTML version.
    * Add a note above the figure that the font sizes here may differ.
    * Add a note to SetFont about PHP+GD TrueType font sizes in 'points'
      actually being in pixels, and dependency on user's display resolution.

2005-02-20

   Section 1.2 Install:
   * Use $ before shell commands consistently.
   * Fix error in copy command: rgb.inc.php not rgb.inc
   * Add text on configuration settings for TrueType font defaults.
   * Moved configuration part up so as not to split up the two uses of
     "three files" (chmod, and copying).

   Section 4.7 Reference, Fonts:
   * Added a figure at the start of the section showing the built-in GD
     fonts and a sample of TrueType fonts.
   * Note you can't mix TrueType and built-in fonts in an image.
   * Changes to reference material for TrueType font functions to reflect
     the fixes made by the "ttf" patch:
     * SetDefaultTTFont: Accepts pathname or filename; enables TTF.
     * SetFont: Call SetUseTTF or SetDefaultTTFont before use; accepts pathname
       or filename; use empty fontname to just change size.
     * SetTTFPath: Reference note under SetUseTTF, install customization.
     * SetUseTTF: Describe 3 ways to set up TrueType fonts without error.

2005-02-13

  * Fixed typos in examples, concepts/datatypes, example/pie1
