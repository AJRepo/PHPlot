2010-12-16
   * pdf.xsl: Customize the page headers for PDF so the chapter title or
     reference entry name is show on the top of all pages. (By default, it
     isn't shown on the first page of a chapter or refentry, which is a

     data color callback, and truecolor images.
   * callbacks.xml: Deleted. Material moved to advanced.xml
   * main.xml: Changed chapters, moved Functions by Category to after Examples.
   * Makefile: Changed file list due to new chapter.

   Improved documentation for variables used to adjust plot appearance:

     and modify description of SetTitleColor to reference them.
   * developer.xml:
     + Changed arguments to internal function DrawBar.
     + New internal functions: GetBarColors, GetColorIndex, GetDarkColorIndex,
       GetDataColor, GetDataErrorColors, NeedDataDarkColors, NeedErrorBarColors,
       SetColorIndexes, truncate_array.
     + Removed internal functions: SetIndexColor, SetIndexDarkColor.

   * variables.list:
     + Most ndx_*color* variables are now set in SetColorIndexes.
     + Other *color variables now contain a color component array (R,G,B,A)
       rather than a color name or other caller-provided color specification.
     + Removed data_colors_alpha. This became unneeded due to other changes.
     + New member variables: ndx_x_title_color, ndx_y_title_color,

     Rewrote confusing (incorrect) description of stackedarea plot type.

2010-09-25
   * Makefile: Add 2 missing static image filenames. These need to be in
     the Makefile or they won't get copied into the release.

   Document change to axis default positioning:

        Also corrected text on axis position in SetYTickLabelPos, SetYTickPos, 
        SetPlotBorderType, and others.


   * Makefile, callbacks.xml, concepts.xml, examples.xml, install.xml,
     quickstart.xml, reference.xml, webform.xml: Improve PDF production.

     the same line as the opening tag, or the PDF version will contain a
     shaded blank line at the top.
   * pdf.xsl: Add a little padding around monospace verbatim blocks.


2010-09-13
   Documentation for horizontal plot types (which were implemented in
   PHPlot-5.1.2 and PHPlot-5.1.3 as an experimental feature).

   * concepts.xml: Changes for horizontal plots.
     + Add definitions: horizontal plot, vertical plot. Clarify: world coords.
     + Add anchors to data type terms, to allow linking.
     + Add new data types for horizontal plots.
     + Update plot types section to indicate which support horizontal plots.
     + Add table of plot type / data type support.
     + Rewrite "Labels" section to describe new data label types. See note
       in the Changelog appendix of the manual concerning the terminology.
       New subsection: Data value labels.
     + Redid the figures showing labels, to adjust the terminology.

   * reference.xml: Changes for horizontal plots.
     + SetDataType: Accepts 2 new data types.
     + SetDrawXGrid, SetDrawYGrid: Defaults differ for horizontal, vertical.
     + SetXDataLabelPos, SetYDataLabelPos: Horizontal plot data value labels.
     + SetXTickLabelPos, SetYTickLabelPos: Defaults for horizontal plots.
     + Other data label related functions: Add link to Concepts section.

       Clarify data label type in other examples.
   * quickstart.xml: Mention horizontal and vertical plot types available.
   * developer.xml: Clarify layout picture in reference to vertical vs
     horizontal plots. In internal function list, clarify label types.
   * examples/horizbar.php, horizstackedbar.php, horizthinbarline.php: New

   Other changes:
   * functions.xml: Move explanatory text and figures out of this chapter
     and into the Concepts chapter. The Functions chapter was meant to
     just contain functions listed by category, but more content crept in.
     Add links from function categories to sections in the Concepts chapter.
   * concepts.xml: Add new section "Other Elements" with subsections. This
     contains text and figures relocated from the Functions chapter.
   * .ispell_words: Additions

2010-09-09
   * variables.list: Forgot this file when preparing for release with
     PHPlot-5.1.3 and setting the specific PHPlot version. Fixed.

2010-09-08
   Extensive changes to support PDF production of the manual.
   * README: Add information on PDF.
   * Makefile: Add rules for building PDF.
   * gen.vardoc: Generate column width rules for PDF not HTML. These seem
     to be incompatible and only one can work. HTML needs them, but PDF
     /really/ needs them.
   * style.xsl: Ignore image scaling when doing HTML. PDF needs image scales.
   * pdf.xsl: New XSL style sheet for PDF output via Apache FOP.
   * variables.list: One fix to allow PDF to line-break a certain wide cell.
   * examples/histogram.php: Wrapped one line so it fits on PDF page.
   * examples/colorcallbackgradient.php: Fix image size for PDF page.
   * callbacks.xml, concepts.xml, developer.xml, examples.xml, functions.xml,
     quickstart.xml, install.xml, reference.xml: Fixes for PDF, including:
     + Tables need column widths, and some tables need a fixed table width.
     + Images need to be scaled down so they fit on the pages.
     + The table with color samples needed to be regenerated to use both
       the HTML-specific and FO-specific code (PIs) to create the colors.
     + You cannot link to a list element (term) ID in FO (PDF), as you can
       in HTML. Use anchors instead.
     + Supply help for pagination where needed. This included instructions
       to keep elements together, or force page breaks.
     + The format examples table in SetXLabelType had to be changed as it
       was too wide for a PDF page.
   * main.xml: Removed 2 obsolete markup comments

2010-08-30
   For release with PHPlot-5.1.3:
   * Change vague references to release "after 5.1.2" to "5.1.3".

2010-08-27
   Update with changes for new TrueType font default and handling.
   * concepts.xml: Rewrite "TrueType Font Selection" section, correct and
     update path usage information, and add new subsection on default font.
   * reference.xml: Update descriptions of SetDefaultTTFont, SetFont,
     SetFontTTF, SetTTFPath, and SetUseTTF to document how TrueType fonts
     are located.
   * developer.xml: Add new internal function GetDefaultTTFont.
   * variables.list: Remove default value for default_ttfont and reference
     new function GetDefaultTTFont.

   * install.xml: Removed the text suggesting you can change some of the
     configuration settings in phplot.php, especially the TrueType font
     path and default font name. In general, this is a bad idea.

   * concepts.xml: Add note that some GD functions on truecolor images
     are only available with the bundled GD library.

2010-08-21
   * reference.xml: Clarify Set[XY]TimeFormat sets both types of labels
     unless overridden by Set[XY]DataLabelType.
     Add note to Set[XY]TimeFormat and SetPrecision[XY] that these are
     kept for compatibility but using Set[XY]LabelType is preferred.

2010-08-19
   * concepts.xml, install.xml : Removed all references to phplot_data.php,
     including deleting the Extra Data Processing section. This file is no
     longer distributed with PHPLot. (Reference bug report 3048267.)

2010-08-17
   Updated with changes from implementation of horizontal plots (5.1.2 and
   later) and other recent changes. (Horizontal plots are still an
   experimental feature and not documented in the other parts of the manual.)
   * variables.list : Updated with changes to internal variables, including
     new variables, changed initialization, and renamed data_maxy/data_miny.
   * developer.xml : Updated with changes to internal functions, including
     new arguments, new functions, replaced DrawDataLabel with
     DrawDataValueLabel, and changes to which plot drawing functions calls
     which others.

2010-08-14
   * variables.list : Add new internal variable data_columns.
   * developer.xml : Add new internal function CheckDataArray.

2010-08-12
   * examples/histogram.php : Fixed the grayscale value equation to use
     integers. This avoids round-off error which was visible on a test image.

2010-08-06
   * reference.xml: Fix SetDrawXDataLabelLines : Data label lines do
     not in fact work with thinbarline plots, and never have. (They
     would either overlap or extend the actual plot lines.)

2010-07-29
   * concepts.xml: Add section documenting use of the new data color
     callback to customize usage of data colors.
   * examples.xml: Add 2 new examples showing data color callback.
   * callbacks.xml: Rewrite top warning. Callbacks can now return values.
     Add new data_color callback to table.
   * developer.xml: DoCallback now returns whatever the callback returns.
   * reference.xml: Add note and link to section on data color callback
     for 3 cases of data color array usage

2010-07-27
   * developer.xml: Document new argument to internal functions DrawLines,
     DrawDots, DrawLinesError, and DrawDotsError.

2010-07-09
   * Makefile, examples/histogram.php, examples.xml : Changed the 'histogram'
     example to output a JPEG instead of PNG, and changed the Makefile to
     no longer assume every example makes a PNG. This is because that one
     example image as a PNG doubled the size of the download.

2010-06-28
   For release with PHPlot-5.1.2:
   * Change references to versions: "after 5.1.1" becomes "5.1.2".
   * README: Corrections to file list

2010-06-25
   * developer.xml: Document new error checking funtion CheckDataType.
   * variables.list: Clarify that the data array counters (num_data_rows,
     num_recs, records_per_group, total_records) do include all entries
     in the data array, including label and independent variable value.
     Correct description of num_data_rows: it is the number of points or
     point sets, not the number of plot lines.

2010-06-20
   * variables.list: Clarify the difference between variables max_x, max_y,
     min_x, and min_y and the variables plot_max_x, plot_max_y, plot_min_x,
     and plot_min_y. Add reference to SetPlotAreaWorld for the plot_* vars.

2010-06-13
   Documentation for truecolor images (introduced at phplot-5.1.1):
   * concepts.xml: New definitions, new section and subsections on Truecolor.
   * developer.xml: Changes to internal functions for truecolor: SetIndexColor,
     SetIndexDarkColor, SetRGBColor.
   * examples.xml: New example using truecolor to make a photo histogram
     overlay.
   * functions.xml: Link to new constructor; link to new truecolor section.
   * reference.xml: Document new constructor PHPlot_truecolor,
     cross-reference to base constructor, and add note on background image
     type. Document new alpha parameters to SetDataColors, and that
     SetRGBArray takes 3 or 4 element color component arrays.
   * variables.list: New internal variable data_colors_alpha
   * Makefile: removed unused 'dist' target (if you want a source
     distribution, just "make allclean" and pack up the whole directory);
     explicitly list the required files in images/*; fix verbosity; change
     to use the list of examples vs wildcarding *.png for releasing.
   * README: updated tool versions and info on Makefile.

2010-05-30
   * developer.xml: Update plot layout figure and explain the margins, taking
     into account the changes to allow for a wider image border.
     Document new internal functions: CheckOptionArray, GetImageBorderWidth.
   * examples.xml: Fix typo
   * functions.xml: Link to new function: SetImageBorderWidth.
   * reference.xml: Document changes to SetImageBorderType, SetPlotBorderType
     for new controls on image and plot borders, and new function
     SetImageBorderWidth. Fix explanation of image border colors.
   * variables.list: List new variables image_border_width, title_offset.

2010-04-18
   * webform.xml, images/webform.png: New example of a web form with plot.
   * examples.xml, main.xml, Makefile: Changes for new web form example.

2010-04-03
   For release with PHPlot-5.1.1:
   * Change vague references to release "after 5.1.0" to "5.1.1".

2010-03-31
   * reference.xml, concepts.xml: Clarify that the data array must use
     0-based sequential integer indexes. (Based on a problem reported in
     the Help forum.) This was always true, but never actually documented.

   * reference.xml: SetDataColors, SetDataBorderColors, SetErrorBarColors
     are 3 functions that take an array of colors, or a single color.
     Document a way around the restriction of not being able to specify
     a single color as array(R,G,B).

2010-03-26
   * concepts.xml: Document new plot type 'stackedarea'.
   * developer.xml: Internal function DrawArea() has a new parameter.
   * examples.xml: Reference new example stackedarea1.
   * examples/stackedarea1.php: New example of new plot type 'stackedarea'.
   * quickstart.xml: New plot type
   * reference.xml: SetPlotType has a new plot type. For data label lines,
     list only plot types that it does work with.

2010-01-24
   * main.xml: Updated copyright year to 2010.
   * reference.xml: Document fixed behavior of default X axis position.

2009-12-21
   For release with PHPlot-5.1.0:
   * Change vague references to release "after 5.0.7" to "5.1.0".

2009-12-20
   * concepts.xml: Fix description of data type 'text-data'. Under Data types,
     it incorrectly said X=0, 1, 2. Under Plot Types, it correctly said it was
     X=0.5, 1.5, 2.5 but this was missing under 3 of the plot types.

2009-12-18
   Changes related to new Data Colors list:
   * concepts.xml: List the new default data colors, including a color table.
   * variables.list: Add default_colors. Change data_colors,
     error_bar_colors, and data_border_colors.
   * reference.xml: Updated SetDataColors(), SetErrorBarColors(),
     and SetDataBorderColors(). Document new defaults and use of '' to reset
     the maps.

2009-12-14
   Changes related to new Data Label Types controls:
   * concepts.xml: Updated information on tick and data label functions;
     add missing label format types.

   * developer.xml: Document new internal CheckLabels(). Add references to
     new Set[XY]DataLabelType in label formatting, and update descriptions
     of internals FormatLabel() and SetLabelType().

   * functions.xml: Add links to 4 new functions and remove link to
     removed link to function SetDrawYDataLabelLines().

   * reference.xml: Documented 4 new functions Set[XY]DataLabelAngle() and
     Set[XY]DataLabelType().
     Updated descriptions of Set[X]LabelAngle() and Set[XY]LabelType(),
     to reference the new functions, document use of '' as a format type.
     Updated descriptions of SetXDataLabelPos() and SetXTickLabelPos() to
     indicate the change in interaction between these two and how the
     defaults work now.
     Removed function SetDrawYDataLabelLines().  This was never implemented
     and isn't planned.

   * variables.list: Update label_format description, and defaults for X
     and Y label position and angle variables. Added [xy]_data_label_angle.
     Remove unused draw_y_data_label_lines.

   Also:

   * install.xml: Refreshed picture of phpinfo GD listing.
   * quickstart.xml: Removed the list of functions from the Customization
     sections. This duplicates the material in Chapter 4, PHPlot Functions
     By Category, and was out of date.
   * reference.xml: Minor cleanup, corrections, and style fixes.

2009-12-10
   * concepts.xml: Put the definitions into alphabetical order. New section
     added to chapter with info on text, especially TrueType fonts.

     to include the new point shapes.

2009-11-18
   * callbacks.xml, reference.xml: Fix <programlisting> elements to use CDATA
     for contents.

   * callbacks.xml: Added new section about annotating a plot with callbacks.

2009-11-16
   * developer.xml: DrawText() can take NULL or '' for $font.

   * callbacks.xml: new callback 'draw_all'. Several callbacks now provide
     'plot_area' as a parameter.

   * examples.xml, examples/annotate.php : New example added

   * examples/squared1.php, examples/thinbarline1.php,
     examples/thinbarline2.php: switch mt_rand() which gives the same results
     on all platforms, unlike rand().

2009-11-13
   * README: Updated to mention need for Tcl shell to make variablelist.xml,
     updated the tool versions, deleted mention of "make pdf" target.
   * reference.xml: document new method GetDeviceXY()
   * functions.xml: Link to GetDeviceXY

2009-11-06
   The Callbacks chapter is moved from the "Part III, Developer's Guide to
   PHPlot" to "Part I, PHPlot Programming", because it doesn't only apply
   to PHPlot developers. A new chapter under Developers is added, with a
   list of the PHPlot class member variables and brief descriptions.

   * variables.list: New file. This is the data file which is used to
      generate variablelist.xml which contains the table of member variables.
   * gen.vardoc: New file. This is a Tcl script to generate variablelist.xml
      from variables.list
   * Makefile: Add new files, dependencies, and command to generate the
      variablelist.xml file


   * callbacks.xml:
     + Callback access to PHPlot object can also be via global variable.

   * reference.xml:
     + Document additional cases where LightGridColor and GridColor are used.

2009-10-12
   * developer.xml: document SetLabelType as an internal function.
   * reference.xml:
     + Document new feature SetImageBorderType('none').
     + Document existing feature: SetXLabelType('') and SetYLabelType('') to
       reset label formatting to default. Also works if arg is omitted.

2009-07-21
   * reference.xml:
     + Update SetNumberFormat regarding setlocale() and the new hook variable
       locale_override.
     + Fix examples in SetXLabelType for rendering a Euro.
       Helpful information provided by kalvaro on the PHPlot Help forum.

2009-01-21
   For release with PHPlot-5.0.6:
   * Change vague references to release "after 5.0.5" to "5.0.6".

2008-09-21

     + reference: Document new arguments to SetXLabelType and SetYLabelType.
         Add note to SetPrecision[XY] and Set[XY]TimeFormat.

   * Use CDATA for example scripts, instead of processing them through sed
     to escape special XML characters.

2008-09-01
   * Continue changes for new GD/TTF mixed font usage.
     + developer: Document changes to font arguments for internal functions
       ProcessTextGD() and ProcessTextTTF().

2008-07-22
   * Changes for new GD/TTF mixed font usage.
     + developer: Document change to font data arrays. New GetLineSpacing().
     + functions: Rewrite text to not discourage TTF; list 2 new functions.

     + reference: Document, link, and update all text on font usage.
   * Use History subsections in the reference to detail behavior changes
     over previous releases. This text used to be in Notes. The reference
     section text, other than History, should not mention prior releases.

2008-01-13
   * Change vague references to release "after 5.0.4" to "5.0.5".

2008-01-12
   * Incorporate the callbacks documentation from the "Callbacks" file in
     the source distribution into the manual.
     + developer: Add new chapter on callbacks.
     + functions: Add new category with list of callback functions
     + reference: Document GetCallback, RemoveCallback, SetCallback.

     use the new PHPlot web site on Sourceforge.net instead. Fix GD URL.
     Update peoples' roles to reflect current activities.

2008-01-10
   * examples: Fix area1 example. Top tick should be 100 not 110, and there
     was a typo in a code comment.

   * reference: Explain the 3 available tile modes in SetBgImage and
     SetPlotAreaBgImage.

   * developer: Fix error in tile mode.

2008-01-07

     + developer: Updated layout figure (images/layout.png) and added
         new explanatory text.
         Updated documentation on internal functions.
     + reference: Updated description of SetPlotAreaWorld and SetPlotAreaPixels.

     special version for the Sourceforge project site, with required logo.

2007-12-09
   * Updates to developer section for the rewritten text functions:
     + Internal function TTFBBoxSize is removed.
     + Internal function DrawText is now just a wrapper.
     + Add new internal functions SizeText, ProcessText, ProcessTextGD,
       ProcessTextTTF.
   * Add internal function DoCallback to the developer section.
     (Note that the external functions for the experimental callback
     feature are still only documented outside the manual.)

2007-11-22
   * Updates for latest changes to CVS to improve error handling:
     concepts:
     +  Add new section on error handling. This applies past PHPlot-5.0.4.
     developer:
     +  Update DrawError and PrintError to correspond to changes in the
        implementation of error handling.
     +  Clarify arguments to CheckOption, per fix for bug #1836528.

2007-10-19
   * Change vague references to release "after 5.0rc3" to "5.0.4".

2007-10-11
   * Updates for latest changes to CVS:
     developer:
     +  array_pad_array() and array_merge_php4() are removed.
        Document new pad_array() which replaces these.
     +  Document SetInputFile(). This was overlooked because it was in
        the "Deprecated" section of the code, but it is used by the constructor.
        It was only deprecated for direct external use.
     +  Document new GetImage().

     reference:
     +  Document the requirement that style arrays use zero-based sequential
        integer indexes only. This was previously an undocumented requirement
        for some of them, but now it is required of all.
     +  Document the requirement that SetLineSpacing() be called before
        setting any title text, and not changed after.

2007-10-01
   * Fix reference for SetDrawXDataLabelLines. It said the lines go up from
     the X axis to the points, but that is only the most usual case. In fact
     they can go up or down or both, and not to the X axis but to the plot
     area edges.
     Also cross-reference back from SetXDataLabelPos, and explain what happens
     to the data label lines when a plot has multiple data sets.
 
2007-09-30
   * New Part III - PHPlot Developer's Guide. This includes two layout figures
     (overall plot, and legend), and a list of internal functions. This
     idea for this material comes from the documentation released with
     PHPlot-5.0rc2 and earlier, but has been redone from scratch.

2007-09-08
   * Removed use of reference assignment ($p =& new PHPlot())
     in all inline examples, external examples, and reference material when
     creating a PHPlot object. Added note to PHPlot constructor reference
     explaining why. This was the result of the fix for bug report #1790441,
     which removed the  shutdown function, which was the reason for the
     reference assignment.

   * Document that SetLegendWorld() no longer has to have scale setup before

   * Document SetNumberFormat() (new function added to CVS a while ago), and
     change SetXLabelType and SetYLabelType accordingly.

2007-09-05
   * Change note on SetXLabelType for new behavior: ignoring blank labels.

2007-08-26
   * Document new option in SetLegendStyle: $colorbox_align = 'none'.

2007-08-04
   * Added documentation for new function SetLegendStyle.

2006-12-01
   * No changes, but regenerate the manual because the examples showed
     a change in tick/label counts at 5.0rc3 and this has been patched.

2006-11-29
   * Add new example bars4 showing bar chart data labels.
   * Fix notes comment at top of examples.xml: remove obsolete info on
     scaling of pictures for PDF output. Add notes on example order and
     referencing.

2006-11-28

   * Default 'time' format was fixed at 5.0rc3 as %H:%M:%S.
   * Found and fixed more references to "no Y data labels".

2006-11-27 Changes to catch up to 5.0rc3 release:

   * Update PHP version requirement. Min is 4.3.0 (not 4.2); PHP5 works; always
     use the latest versions.
   * Updated text to more closely match the release README file instructions,
     including ZIP file availability and no TrueType fonts included.
   * Delete note about "included examples and documentation", as they are no
     longer included in the release.

   * Changed 3 examples that use random data to seed the generator with a
     fixed value. So now the graphs won't change and file compares work.

   * Note how to get borderless, unshaded bars with SetDataBorderColors.

   * Document new values in SetPointShapes and SetLineStyles to suppress
     point markers or lines for individual datasets in 'linepoints' plots.
     (New feature in 5.0rc3)

   * Document new bar chart data labels with SetYDataLabelPos('plotin').

   * Add reference to another image viewer: qiv.

2006-09-24

   Reorganized. Reference section is now alphabetically by function,
   with the category grouping moved to a new chapter. This was done
   partly because the previous organization had some odd Table of
   Contents issues.

2006-05-20

   Conversion from SGML to XML, using DocBook-XML and the xsltproc
   processor.

2005-02-27 Released draft manual tagged REL20050227 dated 2005-02-27

2005-02-26

    Section 4.7 Reference, Fonts: TrueType font size issues
    * Don't scale the font figure for PDF; make it smaller so it fits
      on the page at full size. This is necessary so the fonts are
      shown sized to match the HTML version.
    * Add a note above the figure that the font sizes here may differ.
    * Add a note to SetFont about PHP+GD TrueType font sizes in 'points'
      actually being in pixels, and dependency on user's display resolution.

2005-02-20

   Section 1.2 Install:
   * Use $ before shell commands consistently.
   * Fix error in copy command: rgb.inc.php not rgb.inc
   * Add text on configuration settings for TrueType font defaults.
   * Moved configuration part up so as not to split up the two uses of
     "three files" (chmod, and copying).

   Section 4.7 Reference, Fonts:
   * Added a figure at the start of the section showing the built-in GD
     fonts and a sample of TrueType fonts.
   * Note you can't mix TrueType and built-in fonts in an image.
   * Changes to reference material for TrueType font functions to reflect
     the fixes made by the "ttf" patch:
     * SetDefaultTTFont: Accepts pathname or filename; enables TTF.
     * SetFont: Call SetUseTTF or SetDefaultTTFont before use; accepts pathname
       or filename; use empty fontname to just change size.
     * SetTTFPath: Reference note under SetUseTTF, install customization.
     * SetUseTTF: Describe 3 ways to set up TrueType fonts without error.

2005-02-13

  * Fixed typos in examples, concepts/datatypes, example/pie1
