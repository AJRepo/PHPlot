-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2016-01-01
    * main.xml: Indicate next version 6.2.1; extend copyright years to 2016.

    Changes for Feature Request #59, legend border controls:
    * concepts.xml: Updated color and other information on legend border.
    * functions.xml: Added links to 2 new functions.
    * reference.xml: Documented 2 new functions: SetDrawLegendBorder and
       SetLegendBorderColor.
    * variables.list: Added 3 new variables and changed 1 description.

2015-11-05
    * Makefile: Added 2 missing static images (thumbnails for new plot
      types) which were omitted from the manual release.

2015-11-02
    * concepts.xml: Added text about using PHP anonymous functions for
      custom label formatting, with an example.
    * advanced.xml: Added text about using PHP anonymous functions for
      callbacks, with an example under Custom Data Color Selection.

    For release with PHPlot-6.2.0:
    * changelog.xml: Update with summary of all changes for 6.2.0.

2015-10-31
    Changes for Feature Request #58, data borders for area plot types. This
    extends the 2015-10-30 change to area and stackedarea plot types.
    * concepts.xml: Added 2 plot types to those that support data borders.
    * reference.xml: Updated description of SetDrawDataBorders() and
      SetDataBorderColors().

2015-10-30
    * README: Updated tool versions.

    Continued documenting new plot types. Data borders previously applied
    only to bars and stackedbars, and now applies to the new plot types too.
    * advanced.xml: In 'Custom Data Color Selection', fixed explanation of
      data border colors.
    * concepts.xml: In 'Plot Element Colors', renamed 'bar chart bar
      borders' to 'data borders', because it applies to other types too.
      In the descriptions of the new plot types, added text on data borders.
      in 'Plotting Colors', generalized the description of data borders.
      Also fixed description of borders vs shading in 'bars' and 'stackedbars'
      plot types (this was overlooked by a previous PHPlot change).
    * variables.list: Fixed description of 3 variables related to data borders.
    * reference.xml: Updated description of SetDrawDataBorders() and
      SetDataBorderColors() which now apply to more plot types.

2015-10-29
    Continue documenting new plot types:
    * advanced.xml: Add to lists of plot types in sections on custom color
      selection, streaming, and image maps.
    * concepts.xml: Add to lists of plot types in sections on duplicate and
      out-of-order points, missing data, and element colors.
    * reference.xml: List new plot type in SetLegendReverse.

2015-10-28
    Document two new plot types 'squaredarea' and 'stackedsquaredarea':
    (More changes to come)
    * Makefile: Make 2 new examples
    * examples/squaredarea1.php: New example
    * examples/stackedsquaredarea1.php: New example
    * examples.xml: Added 2 examples for the new plot types.
    * reference.xml: Add 2 plot types to SetPlotType().
    * etc/thumbnail.php: Updated the script to get a list of plot types from
      PHPlot, rather than listing them in the script. (It is still necessary
      to edit the script to add a data setup for each new plot type, though.)
      Added setups for the 2 new plot types.
    * images/thumbnail*.png: Regenerated using updated script, including
      2 new thumbnails for the new plot types.
    * developer.xml: Documented 2 new internal functions DrawSquaredArea()
      and SetupAreaPlot(). Link all main plot drawing functions to their
      plot type descriptions.
    * concepts.xml: Add two new plot types to the Plot Types section.
      Added explanation (in footnote) of area filling for 'area' plots.
      Other minor changes to the Plot Types section.

    Also:
    * main.xml: Updated copyright year and next PHPlot version.
    * .ispell_words: Added new function names and other words.

2015-10-23
    Document extension to 'printf' label formatting:
    * reference.xml: SetXLabelType, SetXDataLabelType, SetYLabelType, and
      SetYDataLabelType: 'printf' label format type now accepts 1, 2, or 3
      format strings.

      Add note to SetPieLabelType that it works there too but is not useful.

      Fixed the examples under SetXLabelType.  Some of the examples had
      errors. These have now been copied into a unit test in the test suite
      so they can be checked. All have been corrected, and new examples were
      added. The single Examples table became too long (for PDF), so it had
      to be broken into one table per example. This paginates better in PDF,
      but the down-side is the HTML version has inconsistent column widths
      (this is a Docbook issue).
    * concepts.xml: Document 'printf' label formatting with 2 or 3 format
      strings.
    * developer.xml: label_format[]['printf_format'] can now be an array
      of 1-3 format strings.

2015-10-20
    * developer.xml: Correction: CheckLabels() does not apply defaults
      for data labels from tick labels - this was moved to FormatLabel
      in PHPlot-6.0.0 to better handle multi-plotting.
      Also corrected in the description of the label_format array.

    Removed dependency on Tcl when building manual.
    * gen.vardoc: Rewrite in PHP (which is already required for manual
      building).
    * Makefile: Use PHP to run gen.vardoc
    * README: Remove Tcl dependency.

    * concepts.xml: Document that for a single data set, area and
      stackedarea plots are identical, as are bars and stackedbars.

2015-08-29
    Changes for PHP7:
    * advanced.xml: Changed "Object Methods as Callbacks" to use the
      correct constructor name convention, and rewrote the note to
      explain that the old usage is deprecated at PHP7.
      Also: delete notes about PHP4.
    * advanced.xml, install.xml, reference.xml: Minor changes for PHP7.

2015-03-25
    Changed information on dashed line style internals, from  bug #170:
    * variables.list: Changed description of default_dashed_style variable.
    * developer.xml: Rewrote explanation of SetDashedStyle().

2015-03-20
    Found while doing Feature Request #55 (phpdoc comments):
    * developer.xml:
      + Internal CheckDataValueLabels() is in fact used for both vertical
        and horizontal plots.
      + Internal CalcRangeInit() argument list and return value were
        corrected. (The code changed before 6.0.0 release but the change
        was omitted from the manual.)
      + Fix typos in FormatLabel() and tile_img().
    * variables.list:
      + Fix 3 minor typos in variable descriptions, 1 out-of-order entry

2013-11-20
    * concepts.xml: Rename subsection "Using Special Characters" to "Using
      Extended Characters". Edit to widen the scope, and add a third method:
      UTF-8 encoded characters can be entered directly in PHP strings (if
      you can figure out how to input them).

    * examples/boxplot1.php: Fix for PDF production (prevent para overflow).

2013-11-19
    Fix more errors found while doing Feature Request #55 (phpdoc comments):
    * reference.xml:
      + SetDrawBrokenLines() applies to X also, for horizontal plots.
        Also add link to Concepts section on missing data.
      + SetLegend() was missing information on and link to SetLegendReverse().
      + SetLegendReverse() fix typo and rewrite description.
      + SetPrecisionX() and SetPrecisionY(): fix summary and notes, clarify
        and correct what types of labels these apply to.

2013-11-04
    * reference.xml: Add missing reference from SetLightGridColor() to
      Y data label lines.
    * concepts.xml, reference.xml, examples.xml, developer.xml: Fix several
      uses of "data lines" that should be "data label lines".

      + advanced.xml: Added new section on tuning variables for box plots.
      + concepts.xml: Added box plots to table and section on plot types.
        Added links from plot type descriptions to the section on tuning
        variables for that plot type, if applicable.
        Added a note in Plotting Colors that some plot types use data colors
        in other ways (not for different data sets).
      + developer.xml: Added 1 new internal function.
      + reference.xml: Updated notes for SetDataColors() to indicate that
        some plot types use the data colors for other than different data sets.
        (The 3 OHLC types already did this, and the new box plot does too.)
        Updated notes for SetLineWidths() to indicate which plot types support
        line widths, and which ones use line widths for other than different
        data sets. Updated SetPlotType() with new plot type.

    * developer.xml: Updated DecodeDataType() and the functions usd
      to draw error bars. New section on the new $datatypes static array.
    * functions.xml: Added new data type to Error bar Controls section.

2013-04-03 Released manual dated 2013-04-03 for PHPlot-6.0.0

2013-04-02
    * reference.xml: Fixed SetXDataLabelPos(). This was not completely
      updated with the new PHPlot-6.0.0 support for data value labels on
      more plot types.

    * Merged /branches/Rel6 changes back into trunk. Changes recorded below
      with "(/branches/Rel6)" were made on the branch. Note: Subversion
      change history for those changes is only available by looking at
      revision 1558 on the branch, for example: 
         svn log ^/branches/Rel6/phplotdocs/concepts.xml@1558 
      The /branches/Rel6 tree has not been deleted, but may be in the future
      (as recommended in Subversion documentation).

2013-03-22 (/branches/Rel6)
    * advanced.xml, developer.xml, reference.xml: Documented change in the
      minimum ticks default (min_ticks) from 5 to 8, including updating
      the in-line examples.
    * etc/fig-autorange-a.php, images/fig-autorange-[abc].png: Update
      figures per new min_ticks, and restore end adjustment to default  3%.

2013-03-19 (/branches/Rel6)
    * developer.xml: Documented usage change to internal DrawShape() to
      address bug #166, legend vs 'none' point shape.

2013-03-18 (/branches/Rel6)
    * concepts.xml: Documented changes for fix to bug #167 "Fails to find
      a default font on Ubuntu" - new font search list. Also added note
      about non-use of fontconfig.

2013-03-11 (/branches/Rel6)
    * Document changes from 2 to 3 tick selection modes:

      + advanced.xml: Rewrote parts of "Plot Range and Tick Increment
        Calculations" section, to document the new tick selection modes.
        Corrections and clarification throughout this section.

      + developer.xml: Document new internal CalcStepBinary(), and 3 modes
        numeric, date, binary. Changed parameter names for Tune*AutoTicks()
        Minor corrections throughout.

      + reference.xml: Added table of parameter values to TuneXAutoRange(),
        TuneYAutoRange(). Documented parameter change to TuneXAutoTicks()
        and TuneYAutoTicks(): tick_mode replaces datetime_interval.

2013-03-01 (/branches/Rel6)
    * Documented latest changes to auto-range and auto-tick calculations,
      including moving from tuning variables to Tune*() functions.

      + advanced.xml: Added new section on auto-range and auto-tick
        calculations, and removed section on tuning variables for these
        since those variables no longer exist.

      + concepts.xml: Rewrote text that said PHPlot does a bad job with tick
        increments.

      + developer.xml: Documented usage change to internal CalcStep().  Listed
        3 new internal functions. Rewrote notes on $plots array because the
        table cells were too big, and added the new adjust_type key. Also
        added notes on the 2 new class arrays.

      + functions.xml: Added links to 4 new functions.

      + reference.xml: Documented 4 new public functions Tune*(). Added
        cross-reference links to the new functions and new section in Advanced.

      + variables.list: Removed 6 class variables and replaced them with 2
        arrays.

      + etc/fig-autorange-[abc].php: New source scripts for new figures.
      + etc/README: Added info on new auto-range image scripts.
      + images/fig-autorange-[abc].png: New figures used in new section
        on auto-range.

      + examples.xml, examples/ohlcbasic.php, examples/ohlccandlesticks.php,
        examples/ohlccandlesticks2.php: These 3 OHLC examples did not look
        right after PHPlot-6.0.0 extended the Y range to include zero, so
        added tuning function to turn that feature off.

      + examples/ytickanchor.php: Fixed example. This was meant to show the
        need for setting a Y tick anchor at 0, but the 'before' case no longer
        had the problem because PHPlot-6.0.0 by default fixes it. Added use
        of SetPlotAreaWorld() to force the issue, so the example 'works' again.

      + Makefile: List 3 new static image files for release.
      + .ispell_words: Added new method names.

2013-01-17 (/branches/Rel6)
    * More changes for feature request #29 "Finer control over plot element
      colors":
      + .ispell_words: Added new method names.
      + variables.list: Listed 4 new variables for legend color control.
      + functions.xml: Added links to 2 new functions.

2013-01-02 (/branches/Rel6)
    * main.xml: Extend copyright to 2013
    * developer.xml: Member Variable Notes, plots[]: rewrote top description
      to provide more accurate information about the purpose of this array.
      Changed to match code change: draw_axes changed to suppress_axes.

2012-12-27 (/branches/Rel6)
    * developer.xml: Document new class constant version_id.

2012-12-26 (/branches/Rel6)
    * reference.xml: Added cross-reference from SetPieLabelType() to
      SetLabelScalePosition(), especially for turning the labels off.

    * concepts.xml: Added a thumbnail image for each plot type in the Plot
      Types table. (This has been on hold for a while. I wanted the
      pictures in the sections below the table, with the text flowing
      around the images, but that does not work in PDF - something is
      missing Apache fop, maybe. So I put them in the table instead.)
    * images/thumbnail-*.png : 14 new images for plot types table.
    * etc/thumbnail.php, etc/README : Script to make thumbnail images.
    * Makefile : List 14 new static image files.


2012-12-24 (/branches/Rel6)
    * concepts.xml: Fix description of color and line width usage for
       candlesticks and candlesticks2 plots. (Line widths are not used
       when drawing filled rectangles.)

      and #51 "Lines instead of colorboxes in legend":

      + .ispell_words: Added new method names.
      + variables.list: Listed new variables, update descriptions.
      + examples.xml: Added part 3 to Legend with Point Shapes example.
      + examples/legendshape.php: Updated script for plot type variation.
      + examples/legendshape2.php: New script for example of line markers.
      + Makefile: List files for addition to example.
      + advanced.xml: Updated for new feature: line markers in legend.
        Removed outdated note requiring PHP-5.3 or higher.
      + concepts.xml: Updated for new features:  bar chart data border
        control, legend line markers, legend color box border control.
      + developer.xml: Updated legend layout figure description to account
        for new line markers. Changed usage and description of DrawBar(),
        GetBarColors(), SetDashedStyle(). Documented new index to $plots[]
        (also reformatted the table).
      + functions.xml: Added links to 2 new functions.
      + reference.xml:
        SetDataBorderColors(): Updated description of shading vs data borders.

    * install.xml: Changed example filename for phplot-6.
    * README: Updated tool versions.
    * developer.xml: Moved "Class Constants" text into the previous chapter as
      a new section, instead of being a separate chapter. (DocBook was making a
      bad "previous" link from next page, and this change avoids the error.)

2012-12-17 (/branches/Rel6)
    * images/gdinfo.png: Replaced with updated image, showing recent versions
      of libraries used by GD.

2012-10-16 (/branches/Rel6)
    * concepts.xml: Expanded explanation of out-of-order and duplicate value
      data points in data arrays, and moved this into a new subsection.

2012-09-21 (/branches/Rel6)
    * concepts.xml: Added missing "Y data lines" in color elements table.

2012-09-18 (/branches/Rel6)

        updated text in SetDrawXDataLabelLines() to correspond.
        Reference data value labels and data label lines in SetYDataLabelPos().
        Fixed missing data type (data-data-xyz) in SetDataType().
      + functions.xml: Added link to new function.
      + variables.list: Documented new class variable $draw_y_data_label_lines
      + examples/horizlinepts.php: New example, horizontal linepoints plot.
      + examples.xml: New example of horizontal linepoints plot.
      + Makefile: Added new file with example.

2012-09-12 (/branches/Rel6)
    * Changes for feature request #46 "Control pie chart borders":
      + .ispell_words : Added new function names
      + concepts.xml: Updated table of color elements, and added note on
        pie segment border colors.
      + functions.xml: Add links to to 2 new functions
      + reference.xml: Documented new functions SetPieBorderColor()
        and SetDrawPieBorders(). Updated SetGridColor().
      + variables.list: Documented 3 new class variables.

2012-08-27 (/branches/Rel6)
    * reference.xml: SetDefaultTTFont() argument is now optional, and added
      text here and in SetUseTTF() about resetting fonts to defaults.
      SetTransparentColor() argument is now optional, and rewrote some of
      the descriptive text for this function.

2012-08-23 (/branches/Rel6)
    * quickstart.xml: Updated the list of plot types under Customization,
      mostly to fix the obsolete information that error plots can be used
      for stock market graphs (PHPlot now has OHLC plots for that).
    * concepts.xml: Stated that error handler returning FALSE will result
      in PHP error handling, so the script will exit.

    * Updated for class variable visibility and initialization changes.
      + advanced.xml: Variables have default values, not unset by default.
      + concepts.xml: Noted that color map has the available color names,
        not the available colors.
      + developer.xml: Noted that most variables now have protected
        visibility. Exception is the tuning variables. Redid explanation
        of Default Value column in table of variables (undoes some of
        2012-06-15 change).
      + variables.list: Fix default values, and added a few variable name
        changes and new variable. Don't list colors, as they are not assigned
        as defaults in the class variable declarations.

2012-08-09 (/branches/Rel6)
    * Changes to fix problem with grid drawing defaults being stored back
      into the class, and applied to subsequent multiple-plots:
      + developer.xml: Indicated that CalcGridSettings() was removed, and
        documented new internal function GetGridSetting(). Also added a
        comment tag to all removed internal functions, for maintenance.
      + reference.xml: Documented new feature in SetDrawXGrid() and
        SetDrawYGrid(): parameter may be omitted or NULL to restore the
        default behavior.

      + functions.xml: Add links to 2 new functions
      + reference.xml: Document new SetPieStartAngle() and SetPieDirection().
        Fixed SetPieLabelType() description of 'index' type,
        since segments do not now always start at 0 degrees and go clockwise.
      + variables.list: Document new pie_start_angle, pie_direction_cw.
      + examples/pieangle.php: New example file for pie chart options
    * .ispell_words: Updated spelling list

2012-07-08 (/branches/Rel6)
    * Documented changes to internal DrawText() and SizeText() that makes
      them easier to use from a callback.
      + developer.xml: Updated DrawText() and SizeText() descriptions.
      + advanced.xml: Link to DrawText().

2012-07-04 (/branches/Rel6)
    * Checked and corrected errors with documentation for class variables.
      + advanced.xml: Fixed mis-named tuning variables [xy]_tick_inc_integer.
      + variables.list: Added missing variable pie_label_source.
        Added missing variables saved_version, truecolor used by the
            serialize/unserialize methods __sleep() and __wake().
        Fixed mis-named tuning variables [xy]_tick_inc_integer.
        Linked 10 variables to the Tuning Plot Range section.
      + developer.xml: Added missing __sleep() and __wake() methods.

2012-06-29 (/trunk, merged into /branches/Rel6)
    * webform.xml: Fix bug in parameter validation in the example. It did
      not accept 0 for deposit or interest, due to incorrect use of empty()
      vs isset().  Using 0 produces uninteresting results, but it was supposed
      to work.  Found and reported by Sourceforge user bvn1 on the forum.

2012-06-28 (/branches/Rel6)
     + advanced.xml, concepts.xml, developer.xml, examples.xml,
       functions.xml, reference.xml, variables.list: Changed ID values for
       sections in the Advanced chapter that used to be in Concepts, and all
       links to them. They still had the old IDs (conc-*) and now they match
       the others (adv-*) in that chapter.  Note that the IDs are used to
       name the HTML files (for the top-level sections).

2012-06-26 (/branches/Rel6)
    Changes for new plot area range and tick increment calculations:
    + advanced.xml: Added new section "Tuning Plot Range and Tick Increment
      Calculations".
    + developer.xml: Added 6 new internal functions used in range and tick
      increment calculations: CalcPlotRange, CalcRangeInit, CalcStep,
      CalcStep125, CalcStepDateTime, CheckPlotRange.
      Additional changes to related functions, including CalcTicks.
    + reference.xml: Changed description of SetNum[XY]Ticks() and
      Set[XY]TickIncrement() to correspond to changes in tick increment
      calculations. Updated SetPlotAreaWorld().
    + variables.list: Documented 10 new variables used to tune the plot area
      range and tick increment calculations.

    Note: There are issues with some of the examples when run using
    the new (Rel6 branch) PHPlot. Most of the examples are improved,
    but the 3 OHLC examples (5.30-5.32) are made worse due to the new
    "zero magnet" feature, and example 5.37(a) is pointless because
    setting a Y tick anchor at zero is no longer necessary.
    These will be addressed before the next release.

    Note: Descriptions of Set[XY]TickAnchor() need to be updated.


2012-06-15 (/branches/Rel6)
    Changes from recent code cleanup:
    + reference.xml: GetLegendSize() returns FALSE if there is no legend.
    + gen.vardoc: Changed a column header in the generated member variables
      table from "Initialized to" to "Default Value".
    + developer.xml: Fixed unwanted linebreak in FormatPieLabel (did not
      affect output, but interfered with an script that extracts names).
      Rewrote text above Member Variables table, explaining new notation
      "(value)", which means the variable isn't declared at the top of
      the class, but is assigned its default value within the code. This
      lets us document default values for variables that are not declared
      at the top of the class definition.
    + variables.list: Noted default values as "(value)" for variables that
      are not initialized at the top of the class definition. This
      includes 17 recently changed. Also deleted 1 class variable.

2012-06-12 (/branches/Rel6)
    + reference.xml: Clarified SetRGBArray() behavior. Made it clear that
      color names are resolved when used, with the current color array.
      Documented that colors not in the array can also be used.
      Added history section, including upcoming error behavior change.

2012-06-06 (/branches/Rel6)
    Final review and edits for documentation on image maps.
    + .ispell_words: Updated spelling list

      it was ugly in PDF. A few other minor edits.

2012-06-05 (/branches/Rel6)
    Continue documentation for image maps.
    + examples.xml: review and edit image map example descriptions.
    + advanced.xml: Added material from Imagemaps.txt to overview and intro.

2012-06-04 (/branches/Rel6)
    Including documentation for image maps, a previously-experimental
    feature added in PHPlot-5.7.0. The text and examples are based on
    the file Imagemaps.txt included in the PHPlot releases 5.7.0 and 5.8.0.
    + examples/imagemapbars.php, imagemapnonembed.php, imagemappie.php: New
      example files for image maps.
    + images/imagemap-bars.png, imagemap-nonembed.png, imagemap-pie.png:
      Static images - screenshots of the results from the image map examples.
      (These examples produce web pages and cannot be directly included.)
    + Makefile: Add 6 new files for image map examples.
    + examples.xml: Add 3 new examples of image maps.
    + advanced.xml: Add data_points to table of callbacks.
      Started new section on image maps, taken from "Imagemaps.txt" file.
      Note: Only a few subsections have been converted so far.

2012-04-03
    * phplotdoc.css: Set foreground color whenever setting background color
      (mostly applies for programlisting - examples). This ensures it is
      readable if browser colors are changed. But let the browser color and
      font settings be used in all other cases.

2012-04-02
    * changelog.xml: Missing change from 2012-03-31

     5.6.1, since new features have been included.

    * examples/histogram.php: Fix for no border if draw_border is off.
      (This does not change the example image in the manual, because it has
      draw_border on.)

2012-02-22
   * developer.xml: Clarify that internal DoCallback() returns NULL if no
     callback has been set.
   * reference.xml: State that printf format string must have a single
     %-code (uses exactly 1 argument) - fixed in 5 places.

2012-02-21
   For feature request #3442041 "Provide data for generating image maps":
   Note this has been implemented as an experimental feature, meaning it will
   note be documented in the PHPlot Reference Manual until it is completed and
   accepted. However, changes were made to internal functions, and these
   changes are included in the manual for accuracy.
   * developer.xml: Document changes in the argument lists of internal
     functions DrawDot() and DrawBar().

2012-02-17
   For bug report #3486834 "Wrong color for data value labels", and
   feature request #3077554 "Finer control over plot element colors":

     using "after PHPlot-x.y.z", specify actual version instead.

   * advanced.xml: Added note that you can't have multiple callbacks for
     the same name (same 'reason'). Based on a forum help request.  The
     reference for SetCallback() already stated this.

2012-02-05
   For feature request #3481195 "Custom message image":
   * Makefile: Add files for new DrawMessage() example.
   * concepts.xml: Add notes on use of generic font; new subsection on using

2011-12-31
   * examples/pielabeltypedata.php: Changed the data file used by the pie
     label type examples to remove the 2 smallest data values. This avoids
     the round-off problem in bug #3467793 with tiny sectors. (The smaller
     of the two was displayed, and the larger was not, due to the way the
     values are rounded off.) The bug will be addressed, but in the meantime
     the manual will have clean examples.

   * reference.xml: GetCallback(), RemoveCallback(), SetCallback() - rewrite
     note and add History so it doesn't sound like callbacks are still an

     percentage labels', since labels need not show percentage now.  In
     "Plot Type: pie", link to new function SetPieLabelType(). Add note that
     segments less than 1 degree are not plotted. New subsection on pie labels.
   * developer.xml: Document new internals CheckPieLabels(), DrawPieLabel(),
     FormatPieLabel(), GetTextAlignment().
     Document new argument to DrawPlotBorder().

     to suppress labels.
     Add note to SetMarginsPixels() and SetPlotAreaPixels about pie sizing.
     Document new SetPieAutoSize()
     Update description of SetPlotBorderType() which now handles pie charts and
     has different defaults for pie charts.
   * variables.list: Use 'segments' not 'slices' consistently for pie charts.
     Update $label_format to include pie labels.
     Document 3 new variables: $pie_diam_factor $pie_size_factor $pie_full_size

     constructor too.)
   * reference.xml: Link SetFont(), SetFontGD(), and SetFontTTF() to the
     section in the Concepts chapter on text fonts.
   * concepts.xml: Add a section and table with font element names and uses.

2011-08-09

   Restructuring, to move advanced material out of the Concepts chapter.
   * advanced.xml: New chapter. This started with all material on Callbacks
     from callbacks.xml (demoted from chapter to section level 1). Then
     two sections were moved from concepts.xml to the new chapter: custom
     data color callback, and truecolor images.
   * callbacks.xml: Deleted. Material moved to advanced.xml
   * main.xml: Changed chapters, moved Functions by Category to after Examples.
   * Makefile: Changed file list due to new chapter.

   Improved documentation for variables used to adjust plot appearance:

     explanations of some (curently two) of the more complex variables.

2010-10-31
   * developer.xml: Change arguments to internal CalcBarWidths().

2010-10-03
   For release with PHPlot-5.2.0:

     and modify description of SetTitleColor to reference them.
   * developer.xml:
     + Changed arguments to internal function DrawBar.
     + New internal functions: GetBarColors, GetColorIndex, GetDarkColorIndex,
       GetDataColor, GetDataErrorColors, NeedDataDarkColors, NeedErrorBarColors,
       SetColorIndexes, truncate_array.
     + Removed internal functions: SetIndexColor, SetIndexDarkColor.
   * functions.xml: Add new SetXTitleColor, SetYTitleColor (2 places).
   * variables.list:
     + Most ndx_*color* variables are now set in SetColorIndexes.
     + Other *color variables now contain a color component array (R,G,B,A)
       rather than a color name or other caller-provided color specification.
     + Removed data_colors_alpha. This became unneeded due to other changes.
     + New member variables: ndx_x_title_color, ndx_y_title_color,
       x_title_color, y_title_color.

2010-09-27

     Rewrote confusing (incorrect) description of stackedarea plot type.

2010-09-25
   * Makefile: Add 2 missing static image filenames. These need to be in
     the Makefile or they won't get copied into the release.

   Document change to axis default positioning:
   * developer.xml: In CalcAxisPositions, replace obsolete defaults text
        with links to references where the new defaults are described.

        Also corrected text on axis position in SetYTickLabelPos, SetYTickPos, 
        SetPlotBorderType, and others.


   * Makefile, callbacks.xml, concepts.xml, examples.xml, install.xml,
     quickstart.xml, reference.xml, webform.xml: Improve PDF production.
     First line of verbatim blocks (programlisting, screen) needs to be on
     the same line as the opening tag, or the PDF version will contain a
     shaded blank line at the top.
   * pdf.xsl: Add a little padding around monospace verbatim blocks.


2010-09-13
   Documentation for horizontal plot types (which were implemented in
   PHPlot-5.1.2 and PHPlot-5.1.3 as an experimental feature).

   * concepts.xml: Changes for horizontal plots.
     + Add definitions: horizontal plot, vertical plot. Clarify: world coords.
     + Add anchors to data type terms, to allow linking.
     + Add new data types for horizontal plots.
     + Update plot types section to indicate which support horizontal plots.
     + Add table of plot type / data type support.
     + Rewrite "Labels" section to describe new data label types. See note
       in the Changelog appendix of the manual concerning the terminology.
       New subsection: Data value labels.
     + Redid the figures showing labels, to adjust the terminology.

   * reference.xml: Changes for horizontal plots.
     + SetDataType: Accepts 2 new data types.
     + SetDrawXGrid, SetDrawYGrid: Defaults differ for horizontal, vertical.
     + SetXDataLabelPos, SetYDataLabelPos: Horizontal plot data value labels.
     + SetXTickLabelPos, SetYTickLabelPos: Defaults for horizontal plots.
     + Other data label related functions: Add link to Concepts section.

   * examples.xml: Add 3 new examples of horizontal plots.
       Clarify data label type in other examples.
   * quickstart.xml: Mention horizontal and vertical plot types available.
   * developer.xml: Clarify layout picture in reference to vertical vs
     horizontal plots. In internal function list, clarify label types.
   * examples/horizbar.php, horizstackedbar.php, horizthinbarline.php: New

   Other changes:
   * functions.xml: Move explanatory text and figures out of this chapter
     and into the Concepts chapter. The Functions chapter was meant to
     just contain functions listed by category, but more content crept in.
     Add links from function categories to sections in the Concepts chapter.
   * concepts.xml: Add new section "Other Elements" with subsections. This
     contains text and figures relocated from the Functions chapter.
   * .ispell_words: Additions

2010-09-09
   * variables.list: Forgot this file when preparing for release with
     PHPlot-5.1.3 and setting the specific PHPlot version. Fixed.

2010-09-08
   Extensive changes to support PDF production of the manual.
   * README: Add information on PDF.
   * Makefile: Add rules for building PDF.
   * gen.vardoc: Generate column width rules for PDF not HTML. These seem
     to be incompatible and only one can work. HTML needs them, but PDF
     /really/ needs them.
   * style.xsl: Ignore image scaling when doing HTML. PDF needs image scales.
   * pdf.xsl: New XSL style sheet for PDF output via Apache FOP.
   * variables.list: One fix to allow PDF to line-break a certain wide cell.
   * examples/histogram.php: Wrapped one line so it fits on PDF page.
   * examples/colorcallbackgradient.php: Fix image size for PDF page.
   * callbacks.xml, concepts.xml, developer.xml, examples.xml, functions.xml,
     quickstart.xml, install.xml, reference.xml: Fixes for PDF, including:
     + Tables need column widths, and some tables need a fixed table width.
     + Images need to be scaled down so they fit on the pages.
     + The table with color samples needed to be regenerated to use both
       the HTML-specific and FO-specific code (PIs) to create the colors.
     + You cannot link to a list element (term) ID in FO (PDF), as you can
       in HTML. Use anchors instead.
     + Supply help for pagination where needed. This included instructions
       to keep elements together, or force page breaks.
     + The format examples table in SetXLabelType had to be changed as it
       was too wide for a PDF page.
   * main.xml: Removed 2 obsolete markup comments

2010-08-30
   For release with PHPlot-5.1.3:
   * Change vague references to release "after 5.1.2" to "5.1.3".

2010-08-27
   Update with changes for new TrueType font default and handling.
   * concepts.xml: Rewrite "TrueType Font Selection" section, correct and
     update path usage information, and add new subsection on default font.
   * reference.xml: Update descriptions of SetDefaultTTFont, SetFont,
     SetFontTTF, SetTTFPath, and SetUseTTF to document how TrueType fonts
     are located.
   * developer.xml: Add new internal function GetDefaultTTFont.
   * variables.list: Remove default value for default_ttfont and reference
     new function GetDefaultTTFont.

   * install.xml: Removed the text suggesting you can change some of the
     configuration settings in phplot.php, especially the TrueType font
     path and default font name. In general, this is a bad idea.

   * concepts.xml: Add note that some GD functions on truecolor images
     are only available with the bundled GD library.

2010-08-21
   * reference.xml: Clarify Set[XY]TimeFormat sets both types of labels
     unless overridden by Set[XY]DataLabelType.
     Add note to Set[XY]TimeFormat and SetPrecision[XY] that these are
     kept for compatibility but using Set[XY]LabelType is preferred.

2010-08-19
   * concepts.xml, install.xml : Removed all references to phplot_data.php,
     including deleting the Extra Data Processing section. This file is no
     longer distributed with PHPLot. (Reference bug report 3048267.)

2010-08-17
   Updated with changes from implementation of horizontal plots (5.1.2 and
   later) and other recent changes. (Horizontal plots are still an
   experimental feature and not documented in the other parts of the manual.)
   * variables.list : Updated with changes to internal variables, including
     new variables, changed initialization, and renamed data_maxy/data_miny.
   * developer.xml : Updated with changes to internal functions, including
     new arguments, new functions, replaced DrawDataLabel with
     DrawDataValueLabel, and changes to which plot drawing functions calls
     which others.

2010-08-14
   * variables.list : Add new internal variable data_columns.
   * developer.xml : Add new internal function CheckDataArray.

2010-08-12
   * examples/histogram.php : Fixed the grayscale value equation to use
     integers. This avoids round-off error which was visible on a test image.

2010-08-06
   * reference.xml: Fix SetDrawXDataLabelLines : Data label lines do
     not in fact work with thinbarline plots, and never have. (They
     would either overlap or extend the actual plot lines.)

2010-07-29
   * concepts.xml: Add section documenting use of the new data color
     callback to customize usage of data colors.
   * examples.xml: Add 2 new examples showing data color callback.

     Add new data_color callback to table.
   * developer.xml: DoCallback now returns whatever the callback returns.
   * reference.xml: Add note and link to section on data color callback
     for 3 cases of data color array usage

2010-07-27
   * developer.xml: Document new argument to internal functions DrawLines,
     DrawDots, DrawLinesError, and DrawDotsError.

2010-07-09
   * Makefile, examples/histogram.php, examples.xml : Changed the 'histogram'
     example to output a JPEG instead of PNG, and changed the Makefile to
     no longer assume every example makes a PNG. This is because that one
     example image as a PNG doubled the size of the download.

2010-06-28
   For release with PHPlot-5.1.2:
   * Change references to versions: "after 5.1.1" becomes "5.1.2".
   * README: Corrections to file list

2010-06-25
   * developer.xml: Document new error checking funtion CheckDataType.
   * variables.list: Clarify that the data array counters (num_data_rows,
     num_recs, records_per_group, total_records) do include all entries
     in the data array, including label and independent variable value.
     Correct description of num_data_rows: it is the number of points or
     point sets, not the number of plot lines.

2010-06-20
   * variables.list: Clarify the difference between variables max_x, max_y,
     min_x, and min_y and the variables plot_max_x, plot_max_y, plot_min_x,
     and plot_min_y. Add reference to SetPlotAreaWorld for the plot_* vars.

   * reference.xml: Document new constructor PHPlot_truecolor,
     cross-reference to base constructor, and add note on background image
     type. Document new alpha parameters to SetDataColors, and that
     SetRGBArray takes 3 or 4 element color component arrays.
   * variables.list: New internal variable data_colors_alpha
   * Makefile: removed unused 'dist' target (if you want a source
     distribution, just "make allclean" and pack up the whole directory);
     explicitly list the required files in images/*; fix verbosity; change
     to use the list of examples vs wildcarding *.png for releasing.
   * README: updated tool versions and info on Makefile.

2010-05-30
   * developer.xml: Update plot layout figure and explain the margins, taking
     into account the changes to allow for a wider image border.

2010-04-03
   For release with PHPlot-5.1.1:
   * Change vague references to release "after 5.1.0" to "5.1.1".

2010-03-31
   * reference.xml, concepts.xml: Clarify that the data array must use
     0-based sequential integer indexes. (Based on a problem reported in
     the Help forum.) This was always true, but never actually documented.

   * reference.xml: SetDataColors, SetDataBorderColors, SetErrorBarColors
     are 3 functions that take an array of colors, or a single color.
     Document a way around the restriction of not being able to specify
     a single color as array(R,G,B).

2010-03-26
   * concepts.xml: Document new plot type 'stackedarea'.
   * developer.xml: Internal function DrawArea() has a new parameter.

   For release with PHPlot-5.1.0:
   * Change vague references to release "after 5.0.7" to "5.1.0".

2009-12-20
   * concepts.xml: Fix description of data type 'text-data'. Under Data types,
     it incorrectly said X=0, 1, 2. Under Plot Types, it correctly said it was
     X=0.5, 1.5, 2.5 but this was missing under 3 of the plot types.

2009-12-18
   Changes related to new Data Colors list:
   * concepts.xml: List the new default data colors, including a color table.
   * variables.list: Add default_colors. Change data_colors,
     error_bar_colors, and data_border_colors.

     removed link to function SetDrawYDataLabelLines().

   * reference.xml: Documented 4 new functions Set[XY]DataLabelAngle() and
     Set[XY]DataLabelType().
     Updated descriptions of Set[X]LabelAngle() and Set[XY]LabelType(),
     to reference the new functions, document use of '' as a format type.
     Updated descriptions of SetXDataLabelPos() and SetXTickLabelPos() to
     indicate the change in interaction between these two and how the
     defaults work now.
     Removed function SetDrawYDataLabelLines().  This was never implemented
     and isn't planned.

   * variables.list: Update label_format description, and defaults for X
     and Y label position and angle variables. Added [xy]_data_label_angle.
     Remove unused draw_y_data_label_lines.

     'plot_area' as a parameter.

   * examples.xml, examples/annotate.php : New example added

   * examples/squared1.php, examples/thinbarline1.php,
     examples/thinbarline2.php: switch mt_rand() which gives the same results

   * Updated install prerequisites to indicate PHP4 is no longer supported.

2008-01-05
   * Changes to Makefile and style.xsl stylesheet to allow building a
     special version for the Sourceforge project site, with required logo.

2007-12-09
   * Updates to developer section for the rewritten text functions:
     + Internal function TTFBBoxSize is removed.
     + Internal function DrawText is now just a wrapper.
     + Add new internal functions SizeText, ProcessText, ProcessTextGD,
       ProcessTextTTF.
   * Add internal function DoCallback to the developer section.
     (Note that the external functions for the experimental callback
     feature are still only documented outside the manual.)

2007-11-22
   * Updates for latest changes to CVS to improve error handling:
     concepts:
     +  Add new section on error handling. This applies past PHPlot-5.0.4.
     developer:
     +  Update DrawError and PrintError to correspond to changes in the
        implementation of error handling.
     +  Clarify arguments to CheckOption, per fix for bug #1836528.

2007-10-19
   * Change vague references to release "after 5.0rc3" to "5.0.4".

2007-10-11
   * Updates for latest changes to CVS:
     developer:
     +  array_pad_array() and array_merge_php4() are removed.
        Document new pad_array() which replaces these.
     +  Document SetInputFile(). This was overlooked because it was in
        the "Deprecated" section of the code, but it is used by the constructor.
        It was only deprecated for direct external use.
     +  Document new GetImage().

     reference:
     +  Document the requirement that style arrays use zero-based sequential
        integer indexes only. This was previously an undocumented requirement
        for some of them, but now it is required of all.
     +  Document the requirement that SetLineSpacing() be called before
        setting any title text, and not changed after.

2007-10-01
   * Fix reference for SetDrawXDataLabelLines. It said the lines go up from
     the X axis to the points, but that is only the most usual case. In fact
     they can go up or down or both, and not to the X axis but to the plot
     area edges.
     Also cross-reference back from SetXDataLabelPos, and explain what happens
     to the data label lines when a plot has multiple data sets.
 
2007-09-30
   * New Part III - PHPlot Developer's Guide. This includes two layout figures
     (overall plot, and legend), and a list of internal functions. This
     idea for this material comes from the documentation released with
     PHPlot-5.0rc2 and earlier, but has been redone from scratch.

2007-09-08
   * Removed use of reference assignment ($p =& new PHPlot())
     in all inline examples, external examples, and reference material when
     creating a PHPlot object. Added note to PHPlot constructor reference
     explaining why. This was the result of the fix for bug report #1790441,
     which removed the  shutdown function, which was the reason for the
     reference assignment.

   * Document that SetLegendWorld() no longer has to have scale setup before

   * Document SetNumberFormat() (new function added to CVS a while ago), and
     change SetXLabelType and SetYLabelType accordingly.

2007-09-05
   * Change note on SetXLabelType for new behavior: ignoring blank labels.

2007-08-26
   * Document new option in SetLegendStyle: $colorbox_align = 'none'.

2007-08-04
   * Added documentation for new function SetLegendStyle.

2006-12-01
   * No changes, but regenerate the manual because the examples showed
     a change in tick/label counts at 5.0rc3 and this has been patched.

2006-11-29
   * Add new example bars4 showing bar chart data labels.
   * Fix notes comment at top of examples.xml: remove obsolete info on
     scaling of pictures for PDF output. Add notes on example order and
     referencing.

2006-11-28

   * Default 'time' format was fixed at 5.0rc3 as %H:%M:%S.
   * Found and fixed more references to "no Y data labels".

2006-11-27 Changes to catch up to 5.0rc3 release:

   * Update PHP version requirement. Min is 4.3.0 (not 4.2); PHP5 works; always
     use the latest versions.
   * Updated text to more closely match the release README file instructions,
     including ZIP file availability and no TrueType fonts included.
   * Delete note about "included examples and documentation", as they are no
     longer included in the release.

   * Changed 3 examples that use random data to seed the generator with a
     fixed value. So now the graphs won't change and file compares work.

   * Note how to get borderless, unshaded bars with SetDataBorderColors.

   * Document new values in SetPointShapes and SetLineStyles to suppress
     point markers or lines for individual datasets in 'linepoints' plots.
     (New feature in 5.0rc3)

   * Document new bar chart data labels with SetYDataLabelPos('plotin').

   * Add reference to another image viewer: qiv.

   Reorganized. Reference section is now alphabetically by function,
   with the category grouping moved to a new chapter. This was done
   partly because the previous organization had some odd Table of
   Contents issues.

2006-05-20

   Conversion from SGML to XML, using DocBook-XML and the xsltproc
   processor.

    Section 4.7 Reference, Fonts: TrueType font size issues
    * Don't scale the font figure for PDF; make it smaller so it fits
      on the page at full size. This is necessary so the fonts are
      shown sized to match the HTML version.
    * Add a note above the figure that the font sizes here may differ.
    * Add a note to SetFont about PHP+GD TrueType font sizes in 'points'
      actually being in pixels, and dependency on user's display resolution.

2005-02-20

   Section 1.2 Install:
   * Use $ before shell commands consistently.
   * Fix error in copy command: rgb.inc.php not rgb.inc
   * Add text on configuration settings for TrueType font defaults.
   * Moved configuration part up so as not to split up the two uses of
     "three files" (chmod, and copying).

   Section 4.7 Reference, Fonts:
   * Added a figure at the start of the section showing the built-in GD
     fonts and a sample of TrueType fonts.
   * Note you can't mix TrueType and built-in fonts in an image.
   * Changes to reference material for TrueType font functions to reflect
     the fixes made by the "ttf" patch:
     * SetDefaultTTFont: Accepts pathname or filename; enables TTF.
     * SetFont: Call SetUseTTF or SetDefaultTTFont before use; accepts pathname
       or filename; use empty fontname to just change size.
     * SetTTFPath: Reference note under SetUseTTF, install customization.
     * SetUseTTF: Describe 3 ways to set up TrueType fonts without error.

2005-02-13

  * Fixed typos in examples, concepts/datatypes, example/pie1
