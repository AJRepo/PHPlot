      Also, in the image map section, sorted the sub-sections, list elements,
      and table rows by plot type name for consistency.

2013-04-22
    * Document changes for new plot type 'boxes' (Feature Request #52):
      + examples/boxplot[12].php: 2 new examples of box plots.
      + examples.xml: Added 2 examples of box plots.
      + Makefile: List files for new examples.

        Added links from plot type descriptions to the section on tuning
        variables for that plot type, if applicable.
        Added a note in Plotting Colors that some plot types use data colors
        in other ways (not for different data sets).
      + developer.xml: Added 1 new internal function.
      + reference.xml: Updated notes for SetDataColors() to indicate that
        some plot types use the data colors for other than different data sets.
        (The 3 OHLC types already did this, and the new box plot does too.)
        Updated notes for SetLineWidths() to indicate which plot types support
        line widths, and which ones use line widths for other than different
        data sets. Updated SetPlotType() with new plot type.

      Updated SetXDataLabelAngle() and SetXDataLabelPos() for new
      horizontal error plots.
    * variables.list: Added 2 new static arrays used for data types.

2013-04-03 Released manual dated 2013-04-03 for PHPlot-6.0.0

2013-04-02
    * reference.xml: Fixed SetXDataLabelPos(). This was not completely
      updated with the new PHPlot-6.0.0 support for data value labels on
      more plot types.

2013-04-01
    For release with PHPlot-6.0.0:
    * changelog.xml: Update with summary of all changes for 6.0.0.
    * README: Fix obsolete reference to CVS.

2013-03-27
    * Merged /branches/Rel6 changes back into trunk. Changes recorded below
      with "(/branches/Rel6)" were made on the branch. Note: Subversion
      change history for those changes is only available by looking at
      revision 1558 on the branch, for example: 
         svn log ^/branches/Rel6/phplotdocs/concepts.xml@1558 
      The /branches/Rel6 tree has not been deleted, but may be in the future
      (as recommended in Subversion documentation).

2013-03-22 (/branches/Rel6)
    * advanced.xml, developer.xml, reference.xml: Documented change in the
      minimum ticks default (min_ticks) from 5 to 8, including updating
      the in-line examples.
    * etc/fig-autorange-a.php, images/fig-autorange-[abc].png: Update
      figures per new min_ticks, and restore end adjustment to default  3%.

2013-03-19 (/branches/Rel6)
    * developer.xml: Documented usage change to internal DrawShape() to
      address bug #166, legend vs 'none' point shape.

2013-03-18 (/branches/Rel6)
    * concepts.xml: Documented changes for fix to bug #167 "Fails to find
      a default font on Ubuntu" - new font search list. Also added note
      about non-use of fontconfig.

2013-03-11 (/branches/Rel6)
    * Document changes from 2 to 3 tick selection modes:

      + advanced.xml: Rewrote parts of "Plot Range and Tick Increment
        Calculations" section, to document the new tick selection modes.
        Corrections and clarification throughout this section.

      + developer.xml: Document new internal CalcStepBinary(), and 3 modes
        numeric, date, binary. Changed parameter names for Tune*AutoTicks()
        Minor corrections throughout.

      + reference.xml: Added table of parameter values to TuneXAutoRange(),
        TuneYAutoRange(). Documented parameter change to TuneXAutoTicks()
        and TuneYAutoTicks(): tick_mode replaces datetime_interval.

2013-03-01 (/branches/Rel6)
    * Documented latest changes to auto-range and auto-tick calculations,
      including moving from tuning variables to Tune*() functions.

      + advanced.xml: Added new section on auto-range and auto-tick
        calculations, and removed section on tuning variables for these
        since those variables no longer exist.

      + concepts.xml: Rewrote text that said PHPlot does a bad job with tick
        increments.

      + developer.xml: Documented usage change to internal CalcStep().  Listed
        3 new internal functions. Rewrote notes on $plots array because the
        table cells were too big, and added the new adjust_type key. Also
        added notes on the 2 new class arrays.

      + functions.xml: Added links to 4 new functions.

      + reference.xml: Documented 4 new public functions Tune*(). Added
        cross-reference links to the new functions and new section in Advanced.

      + variables.list: Removed 6 class variables and replaced them with 2
        arrays.

      + etc/fig-autorange-[abc].php: New source scripts for new figures.
      + etc/README: Added info on new auto-range image scripts.
      + images/fig-autorange-[abc].png: New figures used in new section
        on auto-range.

      + examples.xml, examples/ohlcbasic.php, examples/ohlccandlesticks.php,
        examples/ohlccandlesticks2.php: These 3 OHLC examples did not look
        right after PHPlot-6.0.0 extended the Y range to include zero, so
        added tuning function to turn that feature off.

      + examples/ytickanchor.php: Fixed example. This was meant to show the
        need for setting a Y tick anchor at 0, but the 'before' case no longer
        had the problem because PHPlot-6.0.0 by default fixes it. Added use
        of SetPlotAreaWorld() to force the issue, so the example 'works' again.

      + Makefile: List 3 new static image files for release.
      + .ispell_words: Added new method names.

2013-01-17 (/branches/Rel6)
    * More changes for feature request #29 "Finer control over plot element
      colors":
      + .ispell_words: Added new method names.
      + variables.list: Listed 4 new variables for legend color control.
      + functions.xml: Added links to 2 new functions.
      + concepts.xml: Updated element color table and notes, and legend
        section, to account for new functions.
      + reference.xml: Documented new functions SetLegendBgColor() and
        SetLegendTextColor(), and updated some cross-references.

2013-01-02 (/branches/Rel6)
    * main.xml: Extend copyright to 2013
    * developer.xml: Member Variable Notes, plots[]: rewrote top description
      to provide more accurate information about the purpose of this array.
      Changed to match code change: draw_axes changed to suppress_axes.

2012-12-27 (/branches/Rel6)
    * developer.xml: Document new class constant version_id.

2012-12-26 (/branches/Rel6)
    * reference.xml: Added cross-reference from SetPieLabelType() to
      SetLabelScalePosition(), especially for turning the labels off.

    * concepts.xml: Added a thumbnail image for each plot type in the Plot
      Types table. (This has been on hold for a while. I wanted the
      pictures in the sections below the table, with the text flowing
      around the images, but that does not work in PDF - something is
      missing Apache fop, maybe. So I put them in the table instead.)
    * images/thumbnail-*.png : 14 new images for plot types table.
    * etc/thumbnail.php, etc/README : Script to make thumbnail images.
    * Makefile : List 14 new static image files.


2012-12-24 (/branches/Rel6)
    * concepts.xml: Fix description of color and line width usage for
       candlesticks and candlesticks2 plots. (Line widths are not used
       when drawing filled rectangles.)

      and #51 "Lines instead of colorboxes in legend":

      + .ispell_words: Added new method names.
      + variables.list: Listed new variables, update descriptions.
      + examples.xml: Added part 3 to Legend with Point Shapes example.
      + examples/legendshape.php: Updated script for plot type variation.
      + examples/legendshape2.php: New script for example of line markers.
      + Makefile: List files for addition to example.
      + advanced.xml: Updated for new feature: line markers in legend.
        Removed outdated note requiring PHP-5.3 or higher.
      + concepts.xml: Updated for new features:  bar chart data border
        control, legend line markers, legend color box border control.
      + developer.xml: Updated legend layout figure description to account
        for new line markers. Changed usage and description of DrawBar(),
        GetBarColors(), SetDashedStyle(). Documented new index to $plots[]
        (also reformatted the table).
      + functions.xml: Added links to 2 new functions.
      + reference.xml:
        SetDataBorderColors(): Updated description of shading vs data borders.
        SetDrawDataBorders(): Documented new function.
        SetLegend(), SetLegendStyle(): Updated for new line markers.
        SetLegendColorboxBorders): Documented new function.
        SetLegendUseShapes(): Updated plot type/marker type information.

    * images/gdinfo.png: Replaced with updated image.
    * install.xml: Changed example filename for phplot-6.
    * README: Updated tool versions.
    * developer.xml: Moved "Class Constants" text into the previous chapter as
      a new section, instead of being a separate chapter. (DocBook was making a
      bad "previous" link from next page, and this change avoids the error.)

2012-12-17 (/branches/Rel6)
    * images/gdinfo.png: Replaced with updated image, showing recent versions
      of libraries used by GD.

2012-10-16 (/branches/Rel6)
    * concepts.xml: Expanded explanation of out-of-order and duplicate value
      data points in data arrays, and moved this into a new subsection.

2012-09-21 (/branches/Rel6)
    * concepts.xml: Added missing "Y data lines" in color elements table.

2012-09-18 (/branches/Rel6)
    * Changes for feature request #47 "Extend horizontal plots to more types":
      + developer.xml: Documented changes to internal functions: Removed
        DrawDotsError() and DrawLinesError(); updated DrawDots() and
        DrawLines() descriptions. Added argument to DrawYDataLabel().
        Added DrawYDataLine().  Changed usage of DrawYErrorBar().
      + concepts.xml: Updated plot type and data type sections to reflect
        new horizontal lines, points, and linepoints plots.
        Add information about data value labels for those plot types.
      + reference.xml: Documented new function SetDrawYDataLabelLines(), and
        updated text in SetDrawXDataLabelLines() to correspond.
        Reference data value labels and data label lines in SetYDataLabelPos().
        Fixed missing data type (data-data-xyz) in SetDataType().
      + functions.xml: Added link to new function.
      + variables.list: Documented new class variable $draw_y_data_label_lines
      + examples/horizlinepts.php: New example, horizontal linepoints plot.
      + examples.xml: New example of horizontal linepoints plot.
      + Makefile: Added new file with example.

2012-09-12 (/branches/Rel6)
    * Changes for feature request #46 "Control pie chart borders":
      + .ispell_words : Added new function names
      + concepts.xml: Updated table of color elements, and added note on
        pie segment border colors.
      + functions.xml: Add links to to 2 new functions
      + reference.xml: Documented new functions SetPieBorderColor()
        and SetDrawPieBorders(). Updated SetGridColor().
      + variables.list: Documented 3 new class variables.

2012-08-27 (/branches/Rel6)
    * reference.xml: SetDefaultTTFont() argument is now optional, and added
      text here and in SetUseTTF() about resetting fonts to defaults.
      SetTransparentColor() argument is now optional, and rewrote some of
      the descriptive text for this function.

2012-08-23 (/branches/Rel6)
    * quickstart.xml: Updated the list of plot types under Customization,
      mostly to fix the obsolete information that error plots can be used
      for stock market graphs (PHPlot now has OHLC plots for that).
    * concepts.xml: Stated that error handler returning FALSE will result
      in PHP error handling, so the script will exit.

2012-08-20 (/branches/Rel6)
    * Updated for class variable visibility and initialization changes.
      + advanced.xml: Variables have default values, not unset by default.
      + concepts.xml: Noted that color map has the available color names,
        not the available colors.
      + developer.xml: Noted that most variables now have protected
        visibility. Exception is the tuning variables. Redid explanation
        of Default Value column in table of variables (undoes some of
        2012-06-15 change).
      + variables.list: Fix default values, and added a few variable name
        changes and new variable. Don't list colors, as they are not assigned
        as defaults in the class variable declarations.

2012-08-09 (/branches/Rel6)
    * Changes to fix problem with grid drawing defaults being stored back
      into the class, and applied to subsequent multiple-plots:
      + developer.xml: Indicated that CalcGridSettings() was removed, and
        documented new internal function GetGridSetting(). Also added a
        comment tag to all removed internal functions, for maintenance.
      + reference.xml: Documented new feature in SetDrawXGrid() and
        SetDrawYGrid(): parameter may be omitted or NULL to restore the
        default behavior.
      + variables.list: Changed descriptions of draw_x_grid, draw_y_grid.
    * variables.list: Fixed typo in is_inline description

2012-08-03 (/branches/Rel6)
    * variables.list: Documented new class variables x_tick_step, y_tick_step.

2012-07-09 (/branches/Rel6)
    * Documented changes for feature request #3541471 "Control pie chart start
      angle":
      + Makefile: Added new file with pie chart example
      + advanced.xml: Updated pie chart image map info callback info on
        segment start angle and direction.

        and direction.
      + examples.xml: New example of pie chart options
      + functions.xml: Add links to 2 new functions
      + reference.xml: Document new SetPieStartAngle() and SetPieDirection().
        Fixed SetPieLabelType() description of 'index' type,
        since segments do not now always start at 0 degrees and go clockwise.
      + variables.list: Document new pie_start_angle, pie_direction_cw.
      + examples/pieangle.php: New example file for pie chart options
    * .ispell_words: Updated spelling list

2012-07-08 (/branches/Rel6)
    * Documented changes to internal DrawText() and SizeText() that makes
      them easier to use from a callback.
      + developer.xml: Updated DrawText() and SizeText() descriptions.
      + advanced.xml: Link to DrawText().

2012-07-04 (/branches/Rel6)
    * Checked and corrected errors with documentation for class variables.
      + advanced.xml: Fixed mis-named tuning variables [xy]_tick_inc_integer.
      + variables.list: Added missing variable pie_label_source.
        Added missing variables saved_version, truecolor used by the
            serialize/unserialize methods __sleep() and __wake().
        Fixed mis-named tuning variables [xy]_tick_inc_integer.
        Linked 10 variables to the Tuning Plot Range section.
      + developer.xml: Added missing __sleep() and __wake() methods.

2012-06-29 (/trunk, merged into /branches/Rel6)
    * webform.xml: Fix bug in parameter validation in the example. It did
      not accept 0 for deposit or interest, due to incorrect use of empty()
      vs isset().  Using 0 produces uninteresting results, but it was supposed
      to work.  Found and reported by Sourceforge user bvn1 on the forum.

2012-06-28 (/branches/Rel6)
     + advanced.xml, concepts.xml, developer.xml, examples.xml,
       functions.xml, reference.xml, variables.list: Changed ID values for
       sections in the Advanced chapter that used to be in Concepts, and all
       links to them. They still had the old IDs (conc-*) and now they match
       the others (adv-*) in that chapter.  Note that the IDs are used to
       name the HTML files (for the top-level sections).

2012-06-26 (/branches/Rel6)
    Changes for new plot area range and tick increment calculations:
    + advanced.xml: Added new section "Tuning Plot Range and Tick Increment
      Calculations".
    + developer.xml: Added 6 new internal functions used in range and tick
      increment calculations: CalcPlotRange, CalcRangeInit, CalcStep,
      CalcStep125, CalcStepDateTime, CheckPlotRange.
      Additional changes to related functions, including CalcTicks.
    + reference.xml: Changed description of SetNum[XY]Ticks() and
      Set[XY]TickIncrement() to correspond to changes in tick increment
      calculations. Updated SetPlotAreaWorld().
    + variables.list: Documented 10 new variables used to tune the plot area
      range and tick increment calculations.

    Note: There are issues with some of the examples when run using
    the new (Rel6 branch) PHPlot. Most of the examples are improved,
    but the 3 OHLC examples (5.30-5.32) are made worse due to the new
    "zero magnet" feature, and example 5.37(a) is pointless because
    setting a Y tick anchor at zero is no longer necessary.
    These will be addressed before the next release.

    Note: Descriptions of Set[XY]TickAnchor() need to be updated.


2012-06-15 (/branches/Rel6)
    Changes from recent code cleanup:
    + reference.xml: GetLegendSize() returns FALSE if there is no legend.
    + gen.vardoc: Changed a column header in the generated member variables
      table from "Initialized to" to "Default Value".
    + developer.xml: Fixed unwanted linebreak in FormatPieLabel (did not
      affect output, but interfered with an script that extracts names).
      Rewrote text above Member Variables table, explaining new notation
      "(value)", which means the variable isn't declared at the top of
      the class, but is assigned its default value within the code. This
      lets us document default values for variables that are not declared
      at the top of the class definition.
    + variables.list: Noted default values as "(value)" for variables that
      are not initialized at the top of the class definition. This
      includes 17 recently changed. Also deleted 1 class variable.

2012-06-12 (/branches/Rel6)
    + reference.xml: Clarified SetRGBArray() behavior. Made it clear that
      color names are resolved when used, with the current color array.
      Documented that colors not in the array can also be used.
      Added history section, including upcoming error behavior change.

2012-06-06 (/branches/Rel6)
    Final review and edits for documentation on image maps.
    + .ispell_words: Updated spelling list
    + advanced.xml: Reformat table of imagemap callback parameters because
      it was ugly in PDF. A few other minor edits.

2012-06-05 (/branches/Rel6)
    Continue documentation for image maps.
    + examples.xml: review and edit image map example descriptions.
    + advanced.xml: Added material from Imagemaps.txt to overview and intro.

2012-06-04 (/branches/Rel6)
    Including documentation for image maps, a previously-experimental
    feature added in PHPlot-5.7.0. The text and examples are based on
    the file Imagemaps.txt included in the PHPlot releases 5.7.0 and 5.8.0.
    + examples/imagemapbars.php, imagemapnonembed.php, imagemappie.php: New
      example files for image maps.
    + images/imagemap-bars.png, imagemap-nonembed.png, imagemap-pie.png:
      Static images - screenshots of the results from the image map examples.
      (These examples produce web pages and cannot be directly included.)
    + Makefile: Add 6 new files for image map examples.
    + examples.xml: Add 3 new examples of image maps.
    + advanced.xml: Add data_points to table of callbacks.
      Started new section on image maps, taken from "Imagemaps.txt" file.
      Note: Only a few subsections have been converted so far.

2012-06-03 (/branches/Rel6)

      Just list current information and refer to NEWS and README.


2012-04-03
    * phplotdoc.css: Set foreground color whenever setting background color
      (mostly applies for programlisting - examples). This ensures it is
      readable if browser colors are changed. But let the browser color and
      font settings be used in all other cases.

      formatting functions.
      + developer.xml: Document new usage for internal functions
        CheckDataValueLabels(), DrawDataValueLabel(), DrawXDataLabel(),
        DrawYDataLabel(), and FormatLabel().
      + reference.xml: Changed SetXLabelType(), SetXDataLabelType(),

   Note this has been implemented as an experimental feature, meaning it will
   note be documented in the PHPlot Reference Manual until it is completed and
   accepted. However, changes were made to internal functions, and these
   changes are included in the manual for accuracy.
   * developer.xml: Document changes in the argument lists of internal
     functions DrawDot() and DrawBar().

2012-02-17

2011-12-31
   * examples/pielabeltypedata.php: Changed the data file used by the pie
     label type examples to remove the 2 smallest data values. This avoids
     the round-off problem in bug #3467793 with tiny sectors. (The smaller
     of the two was displayed, and the larger was not, due to the way the
     values are rounded off.) The bug will be addressed, but in the meantime
     the manual will have clean examples.

   * reference.xml: GetCallback(), RemoveCallback(), SetCallback() - rewrite
     note and add History so it doesn't sound like callbacks are still an

     section in the Concepts chapter on text fonts.
   * concepts.xml: Add a section and table with font element names and uses.

     + Images need to be scaled down so they fit on the pages.
     + The table with color samples needed to be regenerated to use both
       the HTML-specific and FO-specific code (PIs) to create the colors.
     + You cannot link to a list element (term) ID in FO (PDF), as you can
       in HTML. Use anchors instead.
     + Supply help for pagination where needed. This included instructions
       to keep elements together, or force page breaks.
     + The format examples table in SetXLabelType had to be changed as it
       was too wide for a PDF page.
   * main.xml: Removed 2 obsolete markup comments

2010-08-30
   For release with PHPlot-5.1.3:
   * Change vague references to release "after 5.1.2" to "5.1.3".

2010-08-27
   Update with changes for new TrueType font default and handling.
   * concepts.xml: Rewrite "TrueType Font Selection" section, correct and
     update path usage information, and add new subsection on default font.
   * reference.xml: Update descriptions of SetDefaultTTFont, SetFont,
     SetFontTTF, SetTTFPath, and SetUseTTF to document how TrueType fonts
     are located.
   * developer.xml: Add new internal function GetDefaultTTFont.
   * variables.list: Remove default value for default_ttfont and reference
     new function GetDefaultTTFont.

   * install.xml: Removed the text suggesting you can change some of the
     configuration settings in phplot.php, especially the TrueType font
     path and default font name. In general, this is a bad idea.

   * concepts.xml: Add note that some GD functions on truecolor images
     are only available with the bundled GD library.

2010-08-21
   * reference.xml: Clarify Set[XY]TimeFormat sets both types of labels
     unless overridden by Set[XY]DataLabelType.
     Add note to Set[XY]TimeFormat and SetPrecision[XY] that these are
     kept for compatibility but using Set[XY]LabelType is preferred.

2010-08-19
   * concepts.xml, install.xml : Removed all references to phplot_data.php,
     including deleting the Extra Data Processing section. This file is no
     longer distributed with PHPLot. (Reference bug report 3048267.)

2010-08-17
   Updated with changes from implementation of horizontal plots (5.1.2 and
   later) and other recent changes. (Horizontal plots are still an
   experimental feature and not documented in the other parts of the manual.)
   * variables.list : Updated with changes to internal variables, including
     new variables, changed initialization, and renamed data_maxy/data_miny.
   * developer.xml : Updated with changes to internal functions, including
     new arguments, new functions, replaced DrawDataLabel with
     DrawDataValueLabel, and changes to which plot drawing functions calls
     which others.

2010-08-14
   * variables.list : Add new internal variable data_columns.
   * developer.xml : Add new internal function CheckDataArray.

2010-08-12
   * examples/histogram.php : Fixed the grayscale value equation to use
     integers. This avoids round-off error which was visible on a test image.

2010-08-06
   * reference.xml: Fix SetDrawXDataLabelLines : Data label lines do
     not in fact work with thinbarline plots, and never have. (They
     would either overlap or extend the actual plot lines.)

2010-07-29
   * concepts.xml: Add section documenting use of the new data color
     callback to customize usage of data colors.
   * examples.xml: Add 2 new examples showing data color callback.
   * callbacks.xml: Rewrite top warning. Callbacks can now return values.
     Add new data_color callback to table.
   * developer.xml: DoCallback now returns whatever the callback returns.
   * reference.xml: Add note and link to section on data color callback
     for 3 cases of data color array usage

2010-07-27
   * developer.xml: Document new argument to internal functions DrawLines,
     DrawDots, DrawLinesError, and DrawDotsError.

2010-07-09
   * Makefile, examples/histogram.php, examples.xml : Changed the 'histogram'
     example to output a JPEG instead of PNG, and changed the Makefile to
     no longer assume every example makes a PNG. This is because that one
     example image as a PNG doubled the size of the download.

2010-06-28
   For release with PHPlot-5.1.2:
   * Change references to versions: "after 5.1.1" becomes "5.1.2".
   * README: Corrections to file list

2010-06-25
   * developer.xml: Document new error checking funtion CheckDataType.
   * variables.list: Clarify that the data array counters (num_data_rows,
     num_recs, records_per_group, total_records) do include all entries
     in the data array, including label and independent variable value.
     Correct description of num_data_rows: it is the number of points or
     point sets, not the number of plot lines.

2010-06-20
   * variables.list: Clarify the difference between variables max_x, max_y,
     min_x, and min_y and the variables plot_max_x, plot_max_y, plot_min_x,
     and plot_min_y. Add reference to SetPlotAreaWorld for the plot_* vars.

     cross-reference to base constructor, and add note on background image
     type. Document new alpha parameters to SetDataColors, and that
     SetRGBArray takes 3 or 4 element color component arrays.
   * variables.list: New internal variable data_colors_alpha
   * Makefile: removed unused 'dist' target (if you want a source
     distribution, just "make allclean" and pack up the whole directory);
     explicitly list the required files in images/*; fix verbosity; change
     to use the list of examples vs wildcarding *.png for releasing.
   * README: updated tool versions and info on Makefile.

2010-05-30
   * developer.xml: Update plot layout figure and explain the margins, taking
     into account the changes to allow for a wider image border.
     Document new internal functions: CheckOptionArray, GetImageBorderWidth.
   * examples.xml: Fix typo
   * functions.xml: Link to new function: SetImageBorderWidth.

2010-04-03
   For release with PHPlot-5.1.1:
   * Change vague references to release "after 5.1.0" to "5.1.1".

2010-03-31
   * reference.xml, concepts.xml: Clarify that the data array must use
     0-based sequential integer indexes. (Based on a problem reported in
     the Help forum.) This was always true, but never actually documented.

   * reference.xml: SetDataColors, SetDataBorderColors, SetErrorBarColors
     are 3 functions that take an array of colors, or a single color.
     Document a way around the restriction of not being able to specify
     a single color as array(R,G,B).

2010-03-26
   * concepts.xml: Document new plot type 'stackedarea'.
   * developer.xml: Internal function DrawArea() has a new parameter.
   * examples.xml: Reference new example stackedarea1.
   * examples/stackedarea1.php: New example of new plot type 'stackedarea'.
   * quickstart.xml: New plot type

   * reference.xml: Changes to SetYDataLabelPos for stackedbars labels.
   * examples.xml: Reference new example stackedbar3.
   * examples/stackedbar3.php: New example of stackedbar chart with data labels.

2010-01-24
   * main.xml: Updated copyright year to 2010.
   * reference.xml: Document fixed behavior of default X axis position.

2009-12-21
   For release with PHPlot-5.1.0:
   * Change vague references to release "after 5.0.7" to "5.1.0".

2009-12-20
   * concepts.xml: Fix description of data type 'text-data'. Under Data types,
     it incorrectly said X=0, 1, 2. Under Plot Types, it correctly said it was
     X=0.5, 1.5, 2.5 but this was missing under 3 of the plot types.

2009-12-18
   Changes related to new Data Colors list:
   * concepts.xml: List the new default data colors, including a color table.
   * variables.list: Add default_colors. Change data_colors,
     error_bar_colors, and data_border_colors.
   * reference.xml: Updated SetDataColors(), SetErrorBarColors(),
     and SetDataBorderColors(). Document new defaults and use of '' to reset
     the maps.

2009-12-14
   Changes related to new Data Label Types controls:
   * concepts.xml: Updated information on tick and data label functions;
     add missing label format types.

   * developer.xml: Document new internal CheckLabels(). Add references to
     new Set[XY]DataLabelType in label formatting, and update descriptions
     of internals FormatLabel() and SetLabelType().

   * functions.xml: Add links to 4 new functions and remove link to
     removed link to function SetDrawYDataLabelLines().

   * reference.xml: Documented 4 new functions Set[XY]DataLabelAngle() and
     Set[XY]DataLabelType().
     Updated descriptions of Set[X]LabelAngle() and Set[XY]LabelType(),
     to reference the new functions, document use of '' as a format type.
     Updated descriptions of SetXDataLabelPos() and SetXTickLabelPos() to
     indicate the change in interaction between these two and how the
     defaults work now.
     Removed function SetDrawYDataLabelLines().  This was never implemented
     and isn't planned.

   * variables.list: Update label_format description, and defaults for X
     and Y label position and angle variables. Added [xy]_data_label_angle.
     Remove unused draw_y_data_label_lines.

   Also:
   * developer.xml: Link xtr() and ytr() to public function GetDeviceXY().
   * install.xml: Refreshed picture of phpinfo GD listing.
   * quickstart.xml: Removed the list of functions from the Customization
     sections. This duplicates the material in Chapter 4, PHPlot Functions
     By Category, and was out of date.
   * reference.xml: Minor cleanup, corrections, and style fixes.

2009-12-10
   * concepts.xml: Put the definitions into alphabetical order. New section
     added to chapter with info on text, especially TrueType fonts.

   * developer.xml: Add note about internal function visibility.

     to include the new point shapes.

2009-11-18
   * callbacks.xml, reference.xml: Fix <programlisting> elements to use CDATA
     for contents.

   * callbacks.xml: Added new section about annotating a plot with callbacks.

2009-11-16
   * developer.xml: DrawText() can take NULL or '' for $font.

   * callbacks.xml: new callback 'draw_all'. Several callbacks now provide
     'plot_area' as a parameter.

   * examples.xml, examples/annotate.php : New example added

   * examples/squared1.php, examples/thinbarline1.php,
     examples/thinbarline2.php: switch mt_rand() which gives the same results
     on all platforms, unlike rand().

   * README: Updated to mention need for Tcl shell to make variablelist.xml,
     updated the tool versions, deleted mention of "make pdf" target.
   * reference.xml: document new method GetDeviceXY()
   * functions.xml: Link to GetDeviceXY

2009-11-06
   The Callbacks chapter is moved from the "Part III, Developer's Guide to
   PHPlot" to "Part I, PHPlot Programming", because it doesn't only apply
   to PHPlot developers. A new chapter under Developers is added, with a
   list of the PHPlot class member variables and brief descriptions.
   * developer.xml:
     + The material on Callbacks is removed (now in its own file).
     + A new chapter Member Variables is added.
   * main.xml:
     + Define two new system entities for new files
     + Fix - SourceForge, not Sourceforge
     + Callbacks chapter inclusion

   * variables.list: New file. This is the data file which is used to
      generate variablelist.xml which contains the table of member variables.
   * gen.vardoc: New file. This is a Tcl script to generate variablelist.xml
      from variables.list
   * Makefile: Add new files, dependencies, and command to generate the
      variablelist.xml file


   * callbacks.xml:
     + Callback access to PHPlot object can also be via global variable.

   * reference.xml:
     + Document additional cases where LightGridColor and GridColor are used.

2009-10-12
   * developer.xml: document SetLabelType as an internal function.
   * reference.xml:
     + Document new feature SetImageBorderType('none').
     + Document existing feature: SetXLabelType('') and SetYLabelType('') to
       reset label formatting to default. Also works if arg is omitted.

2009-07-21
   * reference.xml:
     + Update SetNumberFormat regarding setlocale() and the new hook variable
       locale_override.
     + Fix examples in SetXLabelType for rendering a Euro.
       Helpful information provided by kalvaro on the PHPlot Help forum.

2009-06-13
   * main.xml: Update license information. PHPlot is now under the LGPL.
   * reference.xml: Add notes to SetRGBArray() about finding the rgb.inc.php
       file (related to a recent bug fix), about the default color map, and 
       how to avoid invalid color errors with custom color maps.

2009-05-25
   For next release PHPlot-5.0.7:
   * Updates for new feature allowing partial margin specification.

   * style.xsl: Change Sourceforge.net logo link per 2009-03-09 instructions.

2009-01-21
   For release with PHPlot-5.0.6:
   * Change vague references to release "after 5.0.5" to "5.0.6".

2008-09-21
   * Changes for new label formatting types.
     + reference: Document new arguments to SetXLabelType and SetYLabelType.
         Add note to SetPrecision[XY] and Set[XY]TimeFormat.

   * Use CDATA for example scripts, instead of processing them through sed
     to escape special XML characters.

2008-09-01
   * Continue changes for new GD/TTF mixed font usage.
     + developer: Document changes to font arguments for internal functions
       ProcessTextGD() and ProcessTextTTF().

2008-07-22
   * Changes for new GD/TTF mixed font usage.
     + developer: Document change to font data arrays. New GetLineSpacing().
     + functions: Rewrite text to not discourage TTF; list 2 new functions.
            Recreate the text fonts figure - use a free TrueType font.
     + reference: Document, link, and update all text on font usage.
   * Use History subsections in the reference to detail behavior changes
     over previous releases. This text used to be in Notes. The reference
     section text, other than History, should not mention prior releases.

2008-01-13
   * Change vague references to release "after 5.0.4" to "5.0.5".

2008-01-12
   * Incorporate the callbacks documentation from the "Callbacks" file in
     the source distribution into the manual.
     + developer: Add new chapter on callbacks.
     + functions: Add new category with list of callback functions
     + reference: Document GetCallback, RemoveCallback, SetCallback.

   * Makefile: Added 'install' target to copy the manual files somewhere.

     use the new PHPlot web site on Sourceforge.net instead. Fix GD URL.
     Update peoples' roles to reflect current activities.

2008-01-10
   * examples: Fix area1 example. Top tick should be 100 not 110, and there
     was a typo in a code comment.

   * reference: Explain the 3 available tile modes in SetBgImage and
     SetPlotAreaBgImage.

   * developer: Fix error in tile mode.

2008-01-07
   * Changes for new margin code rewrite:
     + developer: Updated layout figure (images/layout.png) and added
         new explanatory text.
         Updated documentation on internal functions.
     + reference: Updated description of SetPlotAreaWorld and SetPlotAreaPixels.

   * Updated copyright year to 2008.
   * Updated install prerequisites to indicate PHP4 is no longer supported.

2008-01-05
   * Changes to Makefile and style.xsl stylesheet to allow building a
     special version for the Sourceforge project site, with required logo.

2007-12-09
   * Updates to developer section for the rewritten text functions:
     + Internal function TTFBBoxSize is removed.
     + Internal function DrawText is now just a wrapper.
     + Add new internal functions SizeText, ProcessText, ProcessTextGD,
       ProcessTextTTF.
   * Add internal function DoCallback to the developer section.
     (Note that the external functions for the experimental callback
     feature are still only documented outside the manual.)

2007-11-22
   * Updates for latest changes to CVS to improve error handling:
     concepts:
     +  Add new section on error handling. This applies past PHPlot-5.0.4.
     developer:
     +  Update DrawError and PrintError to correspond to changes in the
        implementation of error handling.
     +  Clarify arguments to CheckOption, per fix for bug #1836528.

2007-10-19
   * Change vague references to release "after 5.0rc3" to "5.0.4".

2007-10-11
   * Updates for latest changes to CVS:
     developer:
     +  array_pad_array() and array_merge_php4() are removed.
        Document new pad_array() which replaces these.
     +  Document SetInputFile(). This was overlooked because it was in
        the "Deprecated" section of the code, but it is used by the constructor.
        It was only deprecated for direct external use.
     +  Document new GetImage().

     reference:
     +  Document the requirement that style arrays use zero-based sequential
        integer indexes only. This was previously an undocumented requirement
        for some of them, but now it is required of all.
     +  Document the requirement that SetLineSpacing() be called before
        setting any title text, and not changed after.

2007-10-01
   * Fix reference for SetDrawXDataLabelLines. It said the lines go up from
     the X axis to the points, but that is only the most usual case. In fact
     they can go up or down or both, and not to the X axis but to the plot
     area edges.
     Also cross-reference back from SetXDataLabelPos, and explain what happens
     to the data label lines when a plot has multiple data sets.
 
2007-09-30
   * New Part III - PHPlot Developer's Guide. This includes two layout figures
     (overall plot, and legend), and a list of internal functions. This
     idea for this material comes from the documentation released with
     PHPlot-5.0rc2 and earlier, but has been redone from scratch.

2007-09-08
   * Removed use of reference assignment ($p =& new PHPlot())
     in all inline examples, external examples, and reference material when
     creating a PHPlot object. Added note to PHPlot constructor reference
     explaining why. This was the result of the fix for bug report #1790441,
     which removed the  shutdown function, which was the reason for the
     reference assignment.

   * Document that SetLegendWorld() no longer has to have scale setup before

   * Document SetNumberFormat() (new function added to CVS a while ago), and
     change SetXLabelType and SetYLabelType accordingly.

2007-09-05
   * Change note on SetXLabelType for new behavior: ignoring blank labels.

2007-08-26
   * Document new option in SetLegendStyle: $colorbox_align = 'none'.

2007-08-04
   * Added documentation for new function SetLegendStyle.

2006-12-01
   * No changes, but regenerate the manual because the examples showed
     a change in tick/label counts at 5.0rc3 and this has been patched.

2006-11-29
   * Add new example bars4 showing bar chart data labels.
   * Fix notes comment at top of examples.xml: remove obsolete info on
     scaling of pictures for PDF output. Add notes on example order and
     referencing.

2006-11-28

   * Default 'time' format was fixed at 5.0rc3 as %H:%M:%S.
   * Found and fixed more references to "no Y data labels".

2006-11-27 Changes to catch up to 5.0rc3 release:

   * Update PHP version requirement. Min is 4.3.0 (not 4.2); PHP5 works; always
     use the latest versions.
   * Updated text to more closely match the release README file instructions,
     including ZIP file availability and no TrueType fonts included.
   * Delete note about "included examples and documentation", as they are no
     longer included in the release.

   * Changed 3 examples that use random data to seed the generator with a
     fixed value. So now the graphs won't change and file compares work.

   * Note how to get borderless, unshaded bars with SetDataBorderColors.

   * Document new values in SetPointShapes and SetLineStyles to suppress
     point markers or lines for individual datasets in 'linepoints' plots.
     (New feature in 5.0rc3)

   * Document new bar chart data labels with SetYDataLabelPos('plotin').

   * Add reference to another image viewer: qiv.


2006-11-11 Released manual dated 2006-11-11 to Sourceforge.net

2006-09-24

   Reorganized. Reference section is now alphabetically by function,
   with the category grouping moved to a new chapter. This was done
   partly because the previous organization had some odd Table of
   Contents issues.

2006-05-20

   Conversion from SGML to XML, using DocBook-XML and the xsltproc
   processor.

2005-02-27 Released draft manual tagged REL20050227 dated 2005-02-27

2005-02-26

    Section 4.7 Reference, Fonts: TrueType font size issues
    * Don't scale the font figure for PDF; make it smaller so it fits
      on the page at full size. This is necessary so the fonts are
      shown sized to match the HTML version.
    * Add a note above the figure that the font sizes here may differ.
    * Add a note to SetFont about PHP+GD TrueType font sizes in 'points'
      actually being in pixels, and dependency on user's display resolution.

2005-02-20

   Section 1.2 Install:
   * Use $ before shell commands consistently.
   * Fix error in copy command: rgb.inc.php not rgb.inc
   * Add text on configuration settings for TrueType font defaults.
   * Moved configuration part up so as not to split up the two uses of
     "three files" (chmod, and copying).

   Section 4.7 Reference, Fonts:
   * Added a figure at the start of the section showing the built-in GD
     fonts and a sample of TrueType fonts.
   * Note you can't mix TrueType and built-in fonts in an image.
   * Changes to reference material for TrueType font functions to reflect
     the fixes made by the "ttf" patch:
     * SetDefaultTTFont: Accepts pathname or filename; enables TTF.
     * SetFont: Call SetUseTTF or SetDefaultTTFont before use; accepts pathname
       or filename; use empty fontname to just change size.
     * SetTTFPath: Reference note under SetUseTTF, install customization.
     * SetUseTTF: Describe 3 ways to set up TrueType fonts without error.

2005-02-13

  * Fixed typos in examples, concepts/datatypes, example/pie1
