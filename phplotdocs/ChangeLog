-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2008-09-01
   * Continue changes for new GD/TTF mixed font usage.
     + developer: Document changes to font arguments for internal functions
       ProcessTextGD() and ProcessTextTTF().

2008-07-22
   * Changes for new GD/TTF mixed font usage.
     + developer: Document change to font data arrays. New GetLineSpacing().
     + functions: Rewrite text to not discourage TTF; list 2 new functions.
            Recreate the text fonts figure - use a free TrueType font.
     + reference: Document, link, and update all text on font usage.
   * Use History subsections in the reference to detail behavior changes
     over previous releases. This text used to be in Notes. The reference
     section text, other than History, should not mention prior releases.

2008-01-13
   * Change vague references to release "after 5.0.4" to "5.0.5".

2008-01-12
   * Incorporate the callbacks documentation from the "Callbacks" file in
     the source distribution into the manual.
     + developer: Add new chapter on callbacks.
     + functions: Add new category with list of callback functions
     + reference: Document GetCallback, RemoveCallback, SetCallback.

   * Makefile: Added 'install' target to copy the manual files somewhere.

   * Fixed external links: www.phplot.com is redirecting away now, so
     use the new PHPlot web site on Sourceforge.net instead. Fix GD URL.
     Update peoples' roles to reflect current activities.

2008-01-10
   * examples: Fix area1 example. Top tick should be 100 not 110, and there
     was a typo in a code comment.

   * reference: Explain the 3 available tile modes in SetBgImage and
     SetPlotAreaBgImage.

   * developer: Fix error in tile mode.

2008-01-07
   * Changes for new margin code rewrite:
     + developer: Updated layout figure (images/layout.png) and added
         new explanatory text.
         Updated documentation on internal functions.
     + reference: Updated description of SetPlotAreaWorld and SetPlotAreaPixels.

   * Updated copyright year to 2008.
   * Updated install prerequisites to indicate PHP4 is no longer supported.

2008-01-05
   * Changes to Makefile and style.xsl stylesheet to allow building a
     special version for the Sourceforge project site, with required logo.

2007-12-09
   * Updates to developer section for the rewritten text functions:
     + Internal function TTFBBoxSize is removed.
     + Internal function DrawText is now just a wrapper.
     + Add new internal functions SizeText, ProcessText, ProcessTextGD,
       ProcessTextTTF.
   * Add internal function DoCallback to the developer section.
     (Note that the external functions for the experimental callback
     feature are still only documented outside the manual.)

2007-11-22
   * Updates for latest changes to CVS to improve error handling:
     concepts:
     +  Add new section on error handling. This applies past PHPlot-5.0.4.
     developer:
     +  Update DrawError and PrintError to correspond to changes in the
        implementation of error handling.
     +  Clarify arguments to CheckOption, per fix for bug #1836528.

2007-10-19
   * Change vague references to release "after 5.0rc3" to "5.0.4".

2007-10-11
   * Updates for latest changes to CVS:
     developer:
     +  array_pad_array() and array_merge_php4() are removed.
        Document new pad_array() which replaces these.
     +  Document SetInputFile(). This was overlooked because it was in
        the "Deprecated" section of the code, but it is used by the constructor.
        It was only deprecated for direct external use.
     +  Document new GetImage().

     reference:
     +  Document the requirement that style arrays use zero-based sequential
        integer indexes only. This was previously an undocumented requirement
        for some of them, but now it is required of all.
     +  Document the requirement that SetLineSpacing() be called before
        setting any title text, and not changed after.

2007-10-01
   * Fix reference for SetDrawXDataLabelLines. It said the lines go up from
     the X axis to the points, but that is only the most usual case. In fact
     they can go up or down or both, and not to the X axis but to the plot
     area edges.
     Also cross-reference back from SetXDataLabelPos, and explain what happens
     to the data label lines when a plot has multiple data sets.
 
2007-09-30
   * New Part III - PHPlot Developer's Guide. This includes two layout figures
     (overall plot, and legend), and a list of internal functions. This
     idea for this material comes from the documentation released with
     PHPlot-5.0rc2 and earlier, but has been redone from scratch.

2007-09-08
   * Removed use of reference assignment ($p =& new PHPlot())
     in all inline examples, external examples, and reference material when
     creating a PHPlot object. Added note to PHPlot constructor reference
     explaining why. This was the result of the fix for bug report #1790441,
     which removed the  shutdown function, which was the reason for the
     reference assignment.

   * Document that SetLegendWorld() no longer has to have scale setup before

   * Document SetNumberFormat() (new function added to CVS a while ago), and
     change SetXLabelType and SetYLabelType accordingly.

2007-09-05
   * Change note on SetXLabelType for new behavior: ignoring blank labels.

2007-08-26
   * Document new option in SetLegendStyle: $colorbox_align = 'none'.

2007-08-04
   * Added documentation for new function SetLegendStyle.

2006-12-01
   * No changes, but regenerate the manual because the examples showed
     a change in tick/label counts at 5.0rc3 and this has been patched.

2006-11-29
   * Add new example bars4 showing bar chart data labels.
   * Fix notes comment at top of examples.xml: remove obsolete info on
     scaling of pictures for PDF output. Add notes on example order and
     referencing.

2006-11-28

   * Default 'time' format was fixed at 5.0rc3 as %H:%M:%S.
   * Found and fixed more references to "no Y data labels".

2006-11-27 Changes to catch up to 5.0rc3 release:

   * Update PHP version requirement. Min is 4.3.0 (not 4.2); PHP5 works; always
     use the latest versions.
   * Updated text to more closely match the release README file instructions,
     including ZIP file availability and no TrueType fonts included.
   * Delete note about "included examples and documentation", as they are no
     longer included in the release.

   * Changed 3 examples that use random data to seed the generator with a
     fixed value. So now the graphs won't change and file compares work.

   * Note how to get borderless, unshaded bars with SetDataBorderColors.

   * Document new values in SetPointShapes and SetLineStyles to suppress
     point markers or lines for individual datasets in 'linepoints' plots.
     (New feature in 5.0rc3)

   * Document new bar chart data labels with SetYDataLabelPos('plotin').

   * Add reference to another image viewer: qiv.


2006-11-11 Released manual dated 2006-11-11 to Sourceforge.net

2006-09-24

   Reorganized. Reference section is now alphabetically by function,
   with the category grouping moved to a new chapter. This was done
   partly because the previous organization had some odd Table of
   Contents issues.

2006-05-20

   Conversion from SGML to XML, using DocBook-XML and the xsltproc
   processor.

2005-02-27 Released draft manual tagged REL20050227 dated 2005-02-27

2005-02-26

    Section 4.7 Reference, Fonts: TrueType font size issues
    * Don't scale the font figure for PDF; make it smaller so it fits
      on the page at full size. This is necessary so the fonts are
      shown sized to match the HTML version.
    * Add a note above the figure that the font sizes here may differ.
    * Add a note to SetFont about PHP+GD TrueType font sizes in 'points'
      actually being in pixels, and dependency on user's display resolution.

2005-02-20

   Section 1.2 Install:
   * Use $ before shell commands consistently.
   * Fix error in copy command: rgb.inc.php not rgb.inc
   * Add text on configuration settings for TrueType font defaults.
   * Moved configuration part up so as not to split up the two uses of
     "three files" (chmod, and copying).

   Section 4.7 Reference, Fonts:
   * Added a figure at the start of the section showing the built-in GD
     fonts and a sample of TrueType fonts.
   * Note you can't mix TrueType and built-in fonts in an image.
   * Changes to reference material for TrueType font functions to reflect
     the fixes made by the "ttf" patch:
     * SetDefaultTTFont: Accepts pathname or filename; enables TTF.
     * SetFont: Call SetUseTTF or SetDefaultTTFont before use; accepts pathname
       or filename; use empty fontname to just change size.
     * SetTTFPath: Reference note under SetUseTTF, install customization.
     * SetUseTTF: Describe 3 ways to set up TrueType fonts without error.

2005-02-13

  * Fixed typos in examples, concepts/datatypes, example/pie1
