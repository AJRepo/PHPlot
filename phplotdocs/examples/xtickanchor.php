# PHPlot Example: Using an X tick anchor to control grid lines
# This example is based on a question on the PHPlot forum on 5/8/2011.
# It requires PHPlot >= 5.4.0
require_once 'phplot.php';

# The first data point was recorded at this date/time: (always top of an hour)
# Example: 5/1/2011 at 10:00am
$year = 2011;
$month = 5;
$day = 1;
$hour = 10;

# Number of hourly data points, e.g. 168 for 1 week's worth:
$n_points = 168;
# ==================================================================

# Timestamp for the first data point:
$time0 = mktime($hour, 0, 0, $month, $day, $year); // H M S m d y

mt_srand(1); // For repeatable, identical results

# Build the PHPlot data array from the base data, and base timestamp.
$data = array();
$ts = $time0;
$tick_anchor = NULL;
$d = 5; // Data value
for ($i = 0; $i < $n_points; $i++) {

    # Decode this point's timestamp as hour 0-23:
    $hour = date('G', $ts);

    # Label noon data points with the weekday name, all others unlabelled.
    $label = ($hour == 12) ? strftime('%A', $ts) : '';

    # Remember the first midnight datapoint seen for use as X tick anchor:
    if (!isset($tick_anchor) && $hour == 0)
        $tick_anchor = $ts;

    # Make a random data point, and add a row to the data array:
    $d += mt_rand(-200, 250) / 100; 
    $data[] = array($label, $ts, $d);

    # Step to next hour:
    $ts += 3600;
}

$plot = new PHPlot(800, 600);
$plot->SetImageBorderType('plain'); // For presentation in the manual
$plot->SetTitle('Hourly Data Example Plot');
$plot->SetDataType('data-data');
$plot->SetDataValues($data);
$plot->SetPlotType('lines');

# Make the X tick marks (and therefore X grid lines) 24 hours apart:
$plot->SetXTickIncrement(60 * 60 * 24);
$plot->SetDrawXGrid(True);

# Anchor the X tick marks at midnight. This makes the X grid lines act as
# separators between days of the week, regardless of the starting hour.
# (Except this messes up around daylight saving time changes.)
$plot->SetXTickAnchor($tick_anchor);

# We want both X axis data labels and X tick labels displayed. They will
# be positioned in a way that prevents them from overwriting.
$plot->SetXDataLabelPos('plotdown');
$plot->SetXTickLabelPos('plotdown');

# Increase the left and right margins to leave room for weekday labels.
$plot->SetMarginsPixels(50, 50);

# Tick labels will be formatted as date/times, showing the date:
$plot->SetXLabelType('time', '%Y-%m-%d');
# ... but then we must reset the data label formatting to no formatting.
$plot->SetXDataLabelType('');

# Show tick labels (with dates) at 90 degrees, to fit between the data labels.
$plot->SetXLabelAngle(90);
# ... but then we must reset the data labels to 0 degrees.
$plot->SetXDataLabelAngle(0);

# Force the Y range to 0:100.
$plot->SetPlotAreaWorld(NULL, 0, NULL, 100);

# Now draw the graph:
$plot->DrawGraph();
