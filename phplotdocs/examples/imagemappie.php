/*
Callback handler for generating an image map for a pie chart.

  NOTE: The code in this function is excluded from the license terms for
  PHPlot, the PHPlot Reference Manual, and the PHPlot Test Suite. You may
  freely copy, use, modify, and redistribute the code in this function.
  Attribution is not necessary.  Or, to put it another way, I am placing
  this function in the public domain.

Arguments:
  $im, $passthru : standard arguments for all callbacks.
  $shape : always 'pie'
  $segment : 0 for the first pie segment, 1 for the next, etc.
  $xc, $yc : Center of the pie, in device coordinates
  $wd, $ht : Pie diameters - width (horizontal), height (vertical)
  $start_angle, $end_angle : Segment arc angles, in degrees, offset from
    360. That is, the values are (360-A) for angle A. This is the way
    PHPlot processes the angles for the GD function imagefilledarc().
    Note that sin(360-A) = -sin(A); and cos(360-A) = cos(A).
    Since the Y axis  (sin) is reversed in device, or image, coordinates
    with Y=0 at the top, this works out correctly.

Method used:
    Approximate a pie segment using a polygon. Note the pie is not necessarily
circular, but is an ellipse.
    +  The 1st point is the pie center.
    +  The 2nd point is on the circumference*, at the start angle.
    +  The last point is on the circumference*, at the end angle.
    +  In between the 2nd and last point are N>=0 additional points on the
circumference*, spaced no more than 20 degrees apart. (20 is chosen by
trial and error for a reasonable fit.) So small segments will be approximated
by a single triangle. Larger segments will have more vertices.

    *Note: These points are actually slightly outside the circumference.
This is done by increasing the two radius values by a small amount (2 pixels).
This produces a better fit, for the case where we want to make sure all the
interior is covered, even if some of the exterior is also included.  (Using
the actual radii would result in the area omitting a small part of the pie
interior. For an image map, this would result in dead spaces.)

    The segment subdivisions are made to have about equal angles. This results
in a closer fit. For example, with a maximum sub-segment arc of 20 degrees,
and a segment of 24 degrees, we make two 12 degree sub-segments rather than a
20 degree and a 4 degree.

    Note: Web image map coordinates have 0,0 in upper left, so Y is reversed.

The pass-through argument gets the data array. This is used to include the
pie segment value in the URL and/or tooltip. This will only work with data
type text-data-single, where array values map 1:1 to segment values.
