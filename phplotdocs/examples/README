This directory contains the example sources.
These are used in the top-level Makefile to generate both
the source code examples and the images.

Each file must listed in the Makfile. (They used to be wildcarded, but that
only worked when each created a PNG, and was unable to handle JPG.)

The Makefile has to be able to find the PHP CLI interpreter, and the
scripts need to be able to find phplot.php. It is suggested that you
make a link ../phplot.php to the actual location of PHPlot.
