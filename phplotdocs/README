This is phplotdocs/README, for the PHPlot Reference Manual source
Last updated on 2006-11-27
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the Docbook-XML source files for the PHPlot Reference
Manual. That is, it contains the files you need to build the manual.  You
also need the appropriate tools.  This manual is written with Docbook,
using the XSL style sheets, so you need the Docbook XSL style sheets
and associated tools.

List of files:

  Makefile            Makefile for building the manual
  README              This file
  ChangeLog           Record of changes to the manual
  examples/           Directory of self-producing examples
  html.xsl            XSL style sheet for HTML output
  images/             Image files, other than examples
  main.xml            Main source file for the manual
  *.xml               Other source files for the manual
  phplot.php          Link to the version of PHPlot used for example files.
  etc/                Extra source files, includes scripts for generation
                      of static images.

Tools:

I used the following tools and versions to produce the manual. Other
versions may work too.

   Docbook 4.1
   Docbook XSL Style Sheets docbook-xsl-1.69.1
   xsltproc from libxml2-2.6.22

The above are used to produce the XHTML manual. There is also an
experimental PDF output, using the tools below, but the results are
not yet of a high enough quality to be useful.

   dblatex-0.1.9
   teTeX-3.0


Makefile:

There are some configurable macros at the top of the Makefile which you may
need to change for your installation. Primarily, PHP must be set to the
path to your PHP CLI interpreter to create the examples (see below). For
example:    PHP=/opt/php/bin/php

The Makefile has the following targets:

  "make html" creates the HTML files (in the current directory).
  "make pdf" makes the PDF output phplot.pdf [Experimental]
  "make release" makes a ZIP file containing the HTML files for the manual.
    When unzipped, it will make a directory phplotdocs/ containing all
    the files, with index.html being the starting point.
  "make dist" makes the manual source distribution.
  "make clean" deletes some intermediate files, but leaves the manual output.
  "make allclean" deletes every generated file.


Example Production:

The method for producing the examples requires some explanation. The goal
is to be sure the example figures in the manual are precisely generated by
the example code shown with the figure. To this end, only the PHP scripts
which generate the example figures are provided. The PHP CLI is used to
create the images. Note that the PHP CLI never outputs HTTP headers, so
SetIsInline(True) is not needed.

The Makefile automatically makes two files from each PHP script (*.php). An
image file (*.png) is created using PHPlot, and a text file (*.xml) is
created using a simple script in the Makefile to escape the PHP file for
XML.  The image file and the text file are included into the manual to
form the example figure and the source code which generates it.  So you
need a working installation of PHPlot, with phplot.php found on the PHP
include path, in order for this to work.

The Makefile wildcards the examples/*.php scripts - it does not contain a
list. Therefore if the example scripts are in RCS they have to be checked
out manually before making the manual, or the Makefile will just ignore
them.

Note: It is important to use the right version of PHPlot to make the
examples. (Otherwise, people may try an example and it won't work.) To
ensure a known version, make a link from this directory (where Makefile is)
to the version of phplot.php which is to be used. The oldest version usable
is PHPlot-5.0rc3  (or -rc2 with patches).  If you are using an older
version, results may differ or the examples may fail.


Style Notes:

Writing XML or SGML for Docbook can be a challenge and a chore. I've adopted a
compromise position on indenting text and markup. Generally, I indent
markup blocks by 2 spaces at each level to help show the structure of the
document. But to keep this from getting out of hand, I usually move the top
2 or 3 elements flush to the left margin. This prevents the indent from
moving too far to the right, and also I feel that extremely long indent
blocks don't really help anyone see the structure. For example, I might
write <chapter>, <sect1>, and the top-level <para>s of the section all
flush against the left margin. The other oddity of my SGML, and the one
most noticeable, is that while I indent tags, I usually don't indent text.
In my opinion, it is just not worth the difficulty typing and editing
blocks of indented text.  So you will see writing like this:
|<itemizedlist>
|  <listitem>
|    <para>
|A color name, ...
|    </para>
|  </listitem>
I'm not saying this is the best way to write XML or SGML, just trying to
explain a little about how I do it and that it isn't completely random.


XML vs SGML:

The first versions of this manual were written in DocBook SGML and
converted with DSSSL stylesheet processing tools. The current version
is XML and converted with XSLT processing tools.


HTML vs XHTML:

The selection of an XSL style sheet determines the output format: HTML or
XHTML. Because the XHTML output is more standards-compliant, XHTML was
chosen. The output should display properly in all modern browsers.
