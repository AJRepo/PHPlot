Updates to Part III, Developer's Guide for changes in internal functions

the plot layout.

      <para>
Added new chapter to Developer's Guide on the callbacks feature, and added
documentation of the 3 public functions used with callbacks to the Function
Reference. The text is based on the <filename>Callbacks</filename> file
which was included with PHPlot-5.0.4 (and will removed in the next release).
Although this is now documented in the manual,
the callbacks feature is still considered experimental.
