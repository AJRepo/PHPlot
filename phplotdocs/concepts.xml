      <listitem>
        <para>
A component in a color system which represents the amount of transparency,
or opacity.  At one extreme, an alpha value indicates an opaque object
which covers or hides whatever was drawn before it. At the other extreme,
it indicates a completely transparent object which has no affect on
whatever was drawn before it.

        <para>
The coordinate space used by GD to create images. The origin is at the
upper left corner, X increases to the right, Y increases down, and the units
are pixels. Also known as Pixel Coordinates or GD Coordinates.

        <para>
A programming library used to create and manipulate images.
GD can be found at the <ulink url="http://libgd.org/">GD Graphics
Library home page</ulink>, but is also included with PHP releases.
You can think of GD as a software implementation of a video card.
GD is also available via a PHP extension, and that is what PHPlot uses to
create images.

        <para>
A complete, labeled, graphical representation of some data sets.
In PHPlot, a graph contains a single plot and other elements such as axes,
tick marks, and labels.

        <para>
A plot in which the Y (vertical) axis represents the independent variable, and
the X (horizontal) axis represents the dependent variable values.
In a horizontal bar chart, for example, the bars extend to the right from the
Y axis. A horizontal plot might represent X = F(Y), for example.
(Note: This usage is specific to PHPlot. An alternate approach, not
used by PHPlot, is to swap the X and Y axis orientation to make horizontal
plots.)

      <listitem>
        <para>
A graphical image, represented as data. For example, a PNG file is an image
in PNG format which is stored in a file. PHPlot creates images using the GD
library. A PHPlot image contains one or more graphs (but usually only one).

      <listitem>
        <para>
A color image file, or image in memory, in which each pixel value is an
index into a color map which contains the actual color. Typically, the
pixel value is 8 bits, limiting this type of image to 256 distinct colors.

The graphical representation of one or more data sets.
In PHPlot, each graph contains a single plot, but a plot
can contain representation of multiple data sets (for example,
you can have 3 line charts on a plot).
        </para>
        <para>
Less formally, the term 'plot' is often used for the overall output of
PHPlot: an image with a complete graphical representation of data, with
labels, legend, title, etc.

    <varlistentry>
      <term><anchor id="def-relativecoor" />Relative Coordinates</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
A coordinate space in which the X and Y coordinates represent a fraction of
the size of an object. The point (0,0) is defined as the upper left corner
of the object, and (1,1) is the lower right corner. (Relative coordinate values
are not restricted to the range 0 to 1, however.) So a point specification
in relative coordinates to an object is independent of the size of the object.
This coordinate system is used by <xref linkend="SetLegendPosition"/>.

        <para>
A color image file, or image in memory, in which each pixel value has a
complete representation of the color of that pixel. The pixels may use 24
bits, with 8 bits each for red, blue, and green color components, or 32
bits with an additional alpha component.

        <para>
A plot in which the X axis represents the independent variable, and the Y
axis represents the dependent variable values. This is the usual orientation
for plots, and might represent Y = F(X).
Compare with <link linkend="def-horizplot">horizontal plot</link>.

      <listitem>
        <para>
The coordinate space of the plotted data. This is the real world
coordinate space, in the units of whatever the plotted data measures.
The origin of the world coordinate space is the 0,0 point on the X and Y
axes.
The X coordinate increases to the right, and the Y coordinate increases upwards.
Note that the Y direction of world coordinates is opposite that of device
coordinates.
(World coordinates are only defined for plots in an orthogonal X/Y
coordinate space, so there are no world coordinates for pie charts.)

<title>Programming Overview</title>

  <para>
This section contains an overview of how to use PHPlot.
  </para>
</abstract>

<sect2 id="conc-overview-howitworks">
<title>How It Works</title>
<para>
To create a plot with PHPlot, your PHP script will generally do the
following:
<orderedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
Include the <filename>phplot.php</filename> source using
<literal>require_once</literal>.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
Create an object which is an instance of the <literal>PHPlot</literal> class.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
Use PHPlot functions (methods of the class object) to select the plot type,
present the data array, and optionally change settings which control the
appearance of the plot.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
Output the plot, typically to the user's browser but possibly to a file
instead.
    </para>
  </listitem>
</orderedlist>
The order of operations you use between creating a PHPlot object and output
of the plot does not matter. The PHPlot class sets internal class variables
as you configure the plot, but doesn't do anything with the values until
you are ready. For example, setting a font for the plot title, then setting
the title text, is the same as setting the title text first, then the font.
In both cases, the title will be drawn using the font you selected.
</para>

<note>
  <para>
It is important to remember that if you are writing a PHP script that uses
PHPlot to create an image for a web page, that PHP script must output
<emphasis>only</emphasis> the image data.
If you want your plot image to appear on a web page with text and other images,
you need at least two scripts.
Your main script returns an HTML page which includes an IMG (Image) tag for
the plot.
The IMG tag has a SRC attribute which references the second script, and it
is this second script which creates the PHPlot image.
An example of this can be found in <xref linkend="ex-webform"/>.
You will most likely need a way to communicate parameters from your main
script to your image script. Two good ways to do this are using URL parameters,
and with PHP session variables.
  </para>

  <para>
An alternative to using two scripts - one generating HTML, and one using PHPlot
to create the plot image - is available starting with PHPlot-5.5.0. You can
write a single script which generates HTML and also embeds the PHPlot-generated
plot image.  See <xref linkend="ex-encodeimage"/>.
  </para>

</note>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="conc-overview-annoex">
<title>Annotated Example</title>
<para>
Here is a simple, annotated example of a script which produces an image.
More examples can be found in <xref linkend="examples" />.
</para>

<para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[require_once 'phplot.php';
]]></programlisting>
This brings in the PHPlot source into your script. For this to work,
PHP needs to be able to find the PHPlot source file. A good way to arrange
this is to install PHPlot into a directory outside your web server's
document root and on the PHP Include Path. Other ways are to include a full
path to <filename>phplot.php</filename> when including it, or to copy
<filename>phplot.php</filename> into the same directory as your script.
</para>

<para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[$plot = new PHPlot();
]]></programlisting>
Here we create a new PHPlot object and call it <literal>plot</literal>.
Everything else we do with the plot will be through the $plot object.
</para>

<para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[$plot->SetPlotType('lines');
$plot->SetDataType('text-data');
]]></programlisting>
Here we select the plot type 'lines', for a line plot
(see <xref linkend="conc-plottypes" />),
and indicate our data will be represented in the 'text-data' format
(see <xref linkend="conc-datatypes" />).
</para>

<para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[$plot->SetDataValues($data);
]]></programlisting>
The data array $data is where we store the values to be plotted.
We haven't shown where the data came from, but in a typical application
it might be from a database query.
How the data array is constructed is described in 
<xref linkend="conc-datatypes" />.
</para>

<para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[$plot->SetXDataLabelPos('none');
$plot->SetLineWidths(3);
$plot->SetDrawXGrid(True);
]]></programlisting>
These three functions illustrate how to change the appearance of the plot.
</para>

<para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[$plot->DrawGraph();
]]></programlisting>
This final function call outputs the plot.
More accurately,
this function creates the plot using all the data and settings
which were established by previous functions, and then outputs the plot.
This is a crucial point when using PHPlot: Until you call DrawGraph,
PHPlot is simply recording all the settings resulting from the functions
you call, and saving a copy of your data array. Nothing really happens
until you complete the plot with DrawGraph.

</abstract>

<sect2 id="conc-datatypes-types">
<title>Available Data Types</title>
<para>
The data values to be plotted are presented to PHPlot with
<xref linkend="SetDataValues" />.
In all cases, the data values are stored in a PHP array.
This data array contains elements, themselves also arrays, which are called
records.
Each record contains labels and/or data values.
The 'data type' of the data array determines how PHPlot will interpret
the records in the data array.
To set the data type, use <xref linkend="SetDataType" />.
</para>

<para>
Not all plot types work with all data types. In some cases, the data type
doesn't make sense for that plot type, or perhaps it just isn't
implemented. See <xref linkend="conc-plottypes" /> for a list of available
plot types and which data types are available for each.
<xref linkend="conc-plottype-datatype" /> contains a summary table of
supported plot type / data type combinations.
</para>

      conc-plottype-datatype below. 
-->
  <varlistentry>
    <term><anchor id="text-data" xreflabel="text-data"/>text-data</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>
This is the simplest data type, used for vertical plots where the X values are
implied, rather than specified, and there are one or more Y values for each X.
When using this data type, each record (row) in the data array contains a
label (which can be empty), followed by one or more Y values:
<literal>array('label', y1, y2, ...)</literal>.
PHPlot assigns X=0.5 to the first data record, X=1.5 to the second data record,
and so on.

  <varlistentry>
    <term><anchor id="data-data" xreflabel="data-data"/>data-data</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>
This data type is similar to <literal>text-data</literal> except that the
values of the independent variable X are supplied in the data array rather
than being implied. This is used for vertical plots.
When using this data type, each record (row) in the data array contains a
label (which can be empty), an X value, then one or more Y values:
<literal>array('label', x, y1, y2, ...)</literal>.

  <varlistentry>
    <term><anchor id="data-data-error" xreflabel="data-data-error"/>data-data-error</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>
This data type is used to make error plots - a plot showing values and
error ranges at each point. This is for vertical plots.
When using this data type, each record (row) in the data array contains a
label (which can be empty), an X value, then sets of 3 values for each Y
point: the Y value, error in the positive direction, and error in the
negative direction:
<literal>array('label', x, y1, e1+, e1-, y2, e2+, e2-, ...)</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
Note that both errors (e+ and e-) are given as positive numbers. They
represent the absolute value of the error in the positive and negative
directions respectively. These must be greater than or equal to zero.

  <varlistentry>
    <term><anchor id="text-data-single" xreflabel="text-data-single"/>text-data-single</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>
This data type is only used for pie charts, where the size of each pie
segment is represented by a single row and value. (There are other data types
that work with pie charts too.)
When using this data type, each record (row) in the data array contains a
label (which can be empty), and a single value:
<literal>array('label', value)</literal>.

    <term><anchor id="text-data-yx" xreflabel="text-data-yx"/>text-data-yx</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>
This data type is used for horizontal plots where the Y values are implied,
rather than specified, and there are one or more X values for each Y.
(For horizontal plots, Y is the independent variable.)
When using this data type, each record (row) in the data array contains a
label (which can be empty), followed by one or more X values:
<literal>array('label', x1, x2, ...)</literal>.
PHPlot assigns Y=0.5 to the first data record, Y=1.5 to the second data record,

</sect2>

<sect2 id="conc-datatypes-array">
<title>Building Data Arrays</title>
<para>
In most of the examples in this manual, the data array is built from
constant values in PHP code. For example:
<programlisting><![CDATA[$data = array(
  array('',  0,   0,   0,   0),
  array('',  1,   1,   1, -10),
  array('',  2,   8,   4, -20),
  array('',  3,  27,   9, -30),
  array('',  4,  64,  16, -40),
  array('',  5, 125,  25, -50),
);
]]></programlisting>
This data array contains 6 records, each with an empty label, an X value
(assuming the data type is 'data-data'), and then 3 Y values representing 3
data sets to plot.
</para>

<para>
In a real application, of course, the data values will most likely come
from a calculation, perhaps using values from a database.
This section provides a few sample code fragments which construct
data arrays. We use the PHP ability to append a new value to the end of an
array using <literal>$array[] = ...</literal>.
</para>

<para>
This code fragment creates a data array of type 'text-data' with three
data sets for Y=X+1, Y=X*X/2, and Y=X*X*X/3.
<programlisting><![CDATA[$data = array();
for ($x = 0; $x <= 5; $x++) $data[] = array('', $x+1, $x*$x/2, $x*$x*$x/3);
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
This code fragment creates a data array of type 'data-data' with about
100 points from the equation X * Y = 10.
<programlisting><![CDATA[$data = array();
for ($x = 1.0; $x <= 10.0; $x += 0.1) $data[] = array('', $x, 10.0/$x);
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
The next code fragments use database queries to build data arrays for PHPlot.
In many cases, you can create a query such that the returned columns
correspond to the format of a PHPlot data array record.
The first query result column should be the data label, the second (for
data type 'data-data' only) should be the X value, and subsequent column
results should be one or more Y values (depending on the number of datasets you are plotting).
(Pie charts work differently - see <xref linkend="plottype-pie" />.)
You aren't limited to simple table lookups - you can use the full power of the SQL language
to combine tables and perform calculations on the data.
Be sure to use <literal>ORDER BY</literal> in your SQL query to order the results,
or you will not get predictable plots.
</para>
<para>
Database access methods differ. This code is for PostgreSQL; for MySQL there are
similar functions like <function>mysql_fetch_row()</function>.
<programlisting><![CDATA[$r = pg_query($db, 'SELECT ...');
if (!$r) exit();
$data = array();
$n_rows = pg_num_rows($r);
for ($i = 0; $i < $n_rows; $i++) $data[] = pg_fetch_row($r, $i);
...
$plot->SetDataValues($data);
]]></programlisting>
This works because <function>pg_fetch_row</function> assigns the result
columns from the query to sequentially numbered elements in the array.
</para>
<para>
Using data arrays from database query results also works if the result
columns are in an array which is indexed by the field name, because PHPlot
converts the data array to use numeric indexes.
So with PostgreSQL you can use <function>pg_fetch_assoc()</function>.
You can also use <function>pg_fetch_array()</function>,
but only if you specify the type as <literal>PGSQL_ASSOC</literal>
or <literal>PGSQL_NUM</literal>.
The default type <literal>PGSQL_BOTH</literal> will not work,
because the result array will contain the data values duplicated
under both number and field-name indexes,
and PHPlot will see both copies of the data.
</para>
<para>
Going even further, with a properly designed query you can use
<function>pg_fetch_all()</function> to fetch the entire query result and
assign it to a data array with one statement.
<programlisting><![CDATA[$r = pg_query($db, 'SELECT ...');
if (!$r) exit();
$data = pg_fetch_all($r);
...
$plot->SetDataValues($data);
]]></programlisting>
This uses field-name indexes in the array representing each row, but as noted above PHPlot
will convert the data array to use numeric indexes.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="conc-datatypes-order">
<title>Duplicate and Out-of-order Points</title>
<para>
With data types 'data-data' and 'data-data-error', the independent variable
X is explicitly given for each data point.
With data types 'data-data-yx' and 'data-data-yx-error', the independent
variable Y is explicitly given for each data point.
With data type 'data-data-xyz', the independent variables X and Y
are explicitly given for each data point.
With each of these data types, it is possible to create a data array
with duplicate values for the independent variable(s), or points which are
out of order. For example, with data type 'data-data',
this array has 2 points at X=4, and the 4th row (X=2) is out of order:
<programlisting><![CDATA[// Data type data-data with out-of-order points
$data = array(     // X  Y
            array('', 1, 10),
            array('', 3, 30),
            array('', 4, 40),
            array('', 2, 20),
            array('', 4, 50),
        );
]]></programlisting>
PHPlot will plot the data points as specified in the array, in row order.
Depending on the plot type, this may or may not make sense.
</para>

<para>
With a <link linkend="plottype-points">points</link> plot
(which puts a marker at each data point),
the data array can legitimately contain duplicate or out-of-order
independent variable values (usually X) as shown above.
A <link linkend="plottype-bubbles">bubbles</link> plot using the 'data-data-xyz'
data type can also contain duplicate or out-of-order points by specifying X
and Y values in any order.
(However, two bubbles with the same X and Y will overlap, and one might be
covered and invisible.)

With plot types
<link linkend="plottype-ohlc">ohlc</link>,
<link linkend="plottype-candlesticks">candlesticks</link>,
<link linkend="plottype-candlesticks2">candlesticks2</link>, and
<link linkend="plottype-thinbarline">thinbarline</link>,
out-of-order points are OK but duplicate independent variable values
usually will not produce useful results.
</para>

<para>
On the other hand, with a <link linkend="plottype-lines">lines</link> plot
(which draws lines between the points in the order defined by the data array
rows), it probably makes no sense to have out-of-order or duplicate
independent variable values in the data array.
The same is true for plot types

<sect2 id="conc-datatypes-missing">
<title>Missing Data in Data Arrays</title>
<para>
Most plot types support the concept of missing points.
A missing point is represented in your data array with an empty string
instead of a Y value. (Actually, any non-numeric value works.) For example:
<programlisting><![CDATA[$data = array( array('1996', 45.5),
               array('1997', 53.8),
               array('1998', ''),   # No data available for 1998
               array('1999', 34.1));
]]></programlisting>
(For horizontal plots, the missing value is X not Y.)
</para>

<para>
With the <link linkend="plottype-lines">lines</link>,
<link linkend="plottype-linepoints">linepoints</link>, and
<link linkend="plottype-squared">squared</link> plot types,
there are two ways to handle missing points.
By default, PHPlot will act as if the missing point does not exist,
connecting the points before it and after it. You can use
<xref linkend="SetDrawBrokenLines" /> to leave a gap at the missing point
instead.
</para>

<para>
The <link linkend="plottype-candlesticks">candlesticks</link>,
<link linkend="plottype-candlesticks2">candlesticks2</link>,
and <link linkend="plottype-ohlc">ohlc</link> plot types
support missing points. Specify all four Y values at the missing point
as empty strings. (This does not work with PHPlot-5.4.0 and earlier.)
</para>

<para>
The <link linkend="plottype-area">area</link>,
<link linkend="plottype-stackedarea">stackedarea</link>, and
<link linkend="plottype-stackedbars">stackedbars</link> plot types
do not support missing points. Non-numeric values are taken as zero for
these plot types.
</para>

<para>
All other plot types support missing points and simply ignore the point.
That is, no bar, point shape, thinbar line, etc. will be plotted at that
position.
</para>

<para>
With error plots, missing points are represented by an empty string for the
dependent variable value.
This is the Y value for vertical error plots
(data type <link linkend="data-data-error">data-data-error</link>),
and the X value for horizontal error plots
(data type <link linkend="data-data-yx-error">data-data-yx-error</link>).
There still must be two error value entries in the array for each missing
point, although the actual values of these will be ignored.
</para>

<para>
With data type <link linkend="data-data-xyz">data-data-xyz</link>, missing
points are represented by an empty string for the Y value.  There still must
be a Z value entry in the array for each missing Y, although the Z value is
ignored.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="conc-datatypes-indexes">
<title>Data Array Indexes</title>
<para>
There are some rules you need to follow when building data arrays, in order
for PHPlot to correctly process your data. The following rules apply to the
array indexes, or keys, in your data array.
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
Your data array must be indexed using sequential integers starting with zero.
This is automatically true if you build an array with the empty-brackets
syntax (<literal>$mydata[] = ...</literal>), or if you use the
<literal>array(...)</literal> construct without specifying keys.
Note that this refers only to the data array itself, not the elements of
the data array - the records.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
The data records, which are elements of the data array, are also arrays.
These record arrays are processed by PHPlot using the
<literal>array_values()</literal> function. This means the array keys
are ignored, and the elements of the record are processed in the same order
as they were assigned. As with the data array itself, you can use the
empty-brackets syntax, or the array() language construct, to build records
in the data array. You can also use words (such as database query result
fields) as indexes, as long as the assignments are made in the correct
order.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="conc-datatypes-validation">
<title>Data Array Validation</title>
<para>
PHPlot checks the validity of the data array in 3 stages.
<xref linkend="SetDataValues"/> only checks that it really was given an
array, that the array contains zero-based sequential integer keys, and
that the values are also arrays.
</para>
<para>
More extensive checking takes place when the graph is drawn with
<xref linkend="DrawGraph"/>. At that time, PHPlot checks that the data array
is not empty, and that the rows contain a correct number of entries depending
on the data type. A third stage of checking takes place for specific plot types.
For example, OHLC plots require 4 values, and area plots require the same
number of values for each row. (These requirements are documented in
<xref linkend="conc-plottypes"/>.) If any of these checks fails,
PHPlot produces an error image instead of a plot.
</para>
<para>
An empty plot will be produced if the data array is valid but contains no
numeric Y values (X values for horizontal plots). The result has titles, X
and Y axis with labels and tick marks (except for pie plots), and other
applicable plot features, but no actual plotted data. There is no error or
warning from PHPlot when an empty plot is produced.

<title>Plot Type: area (Area Plot)</title>
<para>
This plot type draws filled areas between lines.
This is often called a <emphasis>cumulative line plot</emphasis> or
<emphasis>component line plot</emphasis>.
Each data set (set of corresponding Y values from each record in the
data array) is plotted in order, with the area
between each line and the next line filled solid. The area between the
last line and the X axis is also filled. The data must be arranged
so the values are (generally) decreasing within each row, because later
drawn filled areas will cover previously drawn areas.
</para>
<para>
This plot type works with data types <xref linkend="text-data"/>
and <xref linkend="data-data"/>.
For 'text-data', the data X values are assumed to be at 0.5+N for N=0,1,2...
</para>
<para>
A minimum of 2 rows (X values and corresponding Y value(s)) is required for
this plot type.  If there are fewer than 2 rows, an empty plot will be produced.
</para>
<para>
This plot type uses the absolute value of each supplied Y, because negative
values do not make sense here. Missing values are taken as zero.
All records in the data array must have the same number of Y values.
</para>
<para>
The areas are filled with colors as set with <xref linkend="SetDataColors" />.

<sect2 id="plottype-bars">
<title>Plot Type: bars (Bar Graph)</title>
<para>
This plot type draws a bar chart, with filled rectangles.
Both vertical and horizontal bar charts are available.
The bars are centered on the X values (for vertical charts),
or on the Y values (for horizontal charts).
The rectangles can have a 3-D look, or be flat with a border.
Multiple data-set plots work, with each one producing a set of bars
offset from the previous set.
</para>
<para>
For vertical bars, use data type <xref linkend="text-data"/>.
The data X values are assumed to be at 0.5+N for N=0,1,2...
For horizontal bars, use data type <xref linkend="text-data-yx"/>.
The data Y values are assumed to be at 0.5+N for N=0,1,2...
No other data type works with bar graphs.
</para>
<para>
If shading is on with <xref linkend="SetShading" /> (default is on with value
5 pixels), then the bars have a 3-D look. If shading is off
(<function>SetShading(0)</function>), the bars are flat rectangles with borders.
The filled rectangle color is set with <xref linkend="SetDataColors" />.
The border color (if shading is off) can be set with
<xref linkend="SetDataBorderColors" />.
</para>
<para>
An empty string (or any non-numeric value) for the dependent variable
(Y for vertical plots, X for horizontal plots) indicates a missing point.
No bar will be drawn at missing point positions.

Any additional numbers (beyond 5) in each row represent outliers. These
are generally points outside the range of Ymin and Ymax, and are used when Ymin
and Ymax are for some low and high (respectively) percentile values, such as
5th and 95th.
</para>

<para>
At each X value, a box plot has the following features:
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
box: A rectangular box is drawn from YQ1 to YQ3.
      </para>
    </listitem>

      <para>
belt: A horizontal line is drawn through the box at the median position Ymid.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
lower whisker: A vertical line is drawn from the bottom center of the box at

is drawn at each given Y value.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
Note that PHPlot does not force any particular interpretation on the numbers
in each row. It draws a box, belt, two whiskers, and zero or more outliers
at each X as described above.
PHPlot does however require that the numbers be in order:
<![CDATA[ Ymin <= YQ1 <= Ymid <= YQ3 <= Ymax
]]>
Any outlier values should be greater than Ymax, or less than Ymin, but
PHPlot does not enforce that.
</para>

<para>
This plot type works with data types <xref linkend="text-data"/>

For 'text-data', the data X values are assumed to be at 0.5+N for N=0,1,2...
</para>

<para>
This plot type requires 5 or more Y values for each X.
Multiple data sets are not supported.
A missing point is indicated by using an empty string (or any non-numeric
value) for either YQ1 or YQ3 (or both). Nothing at all will be drawn at
that position.
If the median value Ymin is an empty string or non-numeric, the belt
(median line) is not drawn, but the rest of the box plot features are.
If either Ymin or Ymax are empty strings or non-numeric, the corresponding
whisker and 'T' end will not be drawn.
Finally, any empty strings or non-numeric values in the outlier positions
of the data array row are ignored.
Regardless of missing values, every row in the data array must still have at
least 5 entries for Y values.
</para>

<para>
This plot type uses 4 colors from the data colors array, indexes 0 through 3.
You can use <xref linkend="SetDataColors"/> to change the colors used in the

The whiskers in a box plot are drawn using the first line style, which defaults
to a solid line. Box plots sometimes use dashed lines for the whiskers.
Use <xref linkend="SetLineStyles"/><literal>('dashed')</literal>

This plot type produces a scatter-plot using filled circles, with the diameter
of each circle representing a Z value for the point.
The range of Z values in the plot is linearly mapped into a range of bubble
sizes, with the lowest plotted Z value producing a bubble with the minimum size,
and the largest Z value producing the largest bubble.
The smallest and largest bubble sizes are automatically calculated
based on the plot area size, but see also <xref linkend="adv-tuning-bubbles"/>.
Note: There is no way to display the actual numeric Z values on the plot.

<sect2 id="plottype-candlesticks">
<title>Plot Type: candlesticks (OHLC Candlesticks Plot)</title>
<para>
This plot type represents the changing price of a financial instrument
(such as a stock or other security) over time.
At each time point, 4 values are plotted: the opening price, the highest price,
the lowest price, and the closing price.
The candlesticks plot type is one of three Open/High/Low/Close (OHLC) plot
types available. It shows the opening and closing prices as the top and bottom
of a narrow rectangle (the candlestick), with an upper wick showing the
highest price, and a lower wick showing the lowest price.
The candlestick body is drawn solid filled if the closing price is lower
than the opening price, and as an outline (unfilled) if the closing price
is higher than the opening price.
(For a variation on this, see
<link linkend="plottype-candlesticks2">candlesticks2</link>.)

<title>Pie Chart with data type: 'text-data-single'</title>
<para>
The data array for pie charts with 'text-data-single' data type is
structured as follows.
Each record in the data array represents a pie segment.
The record is an array of 2 elements: label and value.
By default, the labels from the data array are ignored, but these can be
used to label the pie segments with <xref linkend="SetPieLabelType" />.
The values in the data array set the size of each pie segment.
PHPlot totals up the values and computes the relative size of each segment.
</para>
<para>
For example:
<programlisting><![CDATA[$data = array(array('', 1), array('',4), array('',5));
]]></programlisting>
This makes a pie chart with 3 segments, with sizes 10%, 40%, and 50%.
</para>

<para>
The data array labels can also be used to build a plot legend.
For example, this will produce a pie chart with 3
segments, and a legend with 3 entries using the labels from the data array:
<programlisting><![CDATA[$data = array(array('Gold', 100), array('Silver',35), array('Copper',12));
$plot = new PHPlot();
$plot->SetPlotType('pie');
$plot->SetDataType('text-data-single');
$plot->SetDataValues($data);
foreach ($data as $row) $plot->SetLegend($row[0]); // Copy labels to legend
$plot->DrawGraph();
]]></programlisting>
A slightly more complex example of this can be seen in <xref linkend="ex-pie1"/>.
This only works for the 'text-data-single' data type, where each row or record
in the data array is used to build one pie segment.

the first Y value from each record) is filled first.  Then the area above that
line, up to the sum of the first and second Y values in each record, is
filled next. This repeats until filling the area up to the top-most line,
which is the sum of all the Y values from each record.
</para>
<para>
This plot type works with data types <xref linkend="text-data"/>
and <xref linkend="data-data"/>.
For 'text-data', the data X values are assumed to be at 0.5+N for N=0,1,2...
</para>
<para>
A minimum of 2 rows (X values and corresponding Y value(s)) is required for
this plot type.  If there are fewer than 2 rows, an empty plot will be produced.
</para>
<para>
This plot type uses the absolute value of each supplied Y, because negative
values do not make sense here. Missing values are taken as zero.
All records in the data array must have the same number of Y values.
</para>
<para>
The areas are filled with colors as set with <xref linkend="SetDataColors" />.
Note that data sets are processed with stacked area plots in reverse order
relative to area plots.  With stacked area plots, the first data set (using the
first data color) will be at the bottom, but with area plots it will be at
the top.
Compare <xref linkend="ex-area1"/> and <xref linkend="ex-stackedarea1"/>.
</para>
<para>
An example of this plot type can be seen in
<xref linkend="ex-stackedarea1" />.

<sect2 id="plottype-stackedbars">
<title>Plot Type: stackedbars</title>
<para>
This plot type draws a bar chart with stacked bars.
Both vertical and horizontal stacked bar charts are available.
The bars are centered on the X values (for vertical charts),
or on the Y values (for horizontal charts).
Each data set value contributes one segment of a stack.
That is, the first data set is drawn from the axis in the first
color, then the second data set is drawn stacked on the first
using the second color, etc.
</para>
<para>
Data values greater than zero result in an upward (or rightward) bar.
Data values less than zero result in a downward (or leftward) bar.
Mixing negative and positive values within a row does work, but
the results are not generally useful.
The first non-zero value in any given row determines the direction of that
bar stack.
PHPlot keeps a running total for each row, but does not draw any segment unless
it increases the bar stack height (or length, for horizontal plots).
It also does not draw any segment on the wrong side of the axis
(which is normally at 0).
</para>
<para>
Segments of length zero in a bar stack are usually ignored, but they might
be visible if the axis is moved in the direction opposite to the bar stack
direction.  (For example, axis is at Y=2, stack contains segment values 0
and -4; the 0 segment is drawn down from the axis at Y=2 to Y=0, followed
by the second segment down to -4).
</para>
<para>
For vertical bars, use data type <xref linkend="text-data"/>.
The data X values are assumed to be at 0.5+N for N=0,1,2...
For horizontal bars, use data type <xref linkend="text-data-yx"/>.
The data Y values are assumed to be at 0.5+N for N=0,1,2...
No other data type works with stacked bar plots.
</para>
<para>
If shading is on with <xref linkend="SetShading" /> (default is on with value
5 pixels), then the bars have a 3-D look. If shading is off
(<function>SetShading(0)</function>), the bars are flat rectangles with borders.
The filled rectangle colors for each stacked segment are set with
<xref linkend="SetDataColors" />.
The border color (if shading is off) can be set with
<xref linkend="SetDataBorderColors" />.
</para>
<para>
Missing values (an empty string or any non-numeric value) are taken as zero,
except that they do not result in a visible segment in the case of a moved
axis described above.
</para>
<para>
See also <xref linkend="adv-tuning-bars" />.

Examples of this plot type can be seen in

<xref linkend="ex-stackedbars3" />, and
<xref linkend="ex-horizstackedbar" />.
</para>
<para>
Horizontal stackedbars plots were added in PHPlot-5.1.3.
Support for negative values in stackedbars plots was added in PHPlot-5.2.0.
Before PHPlot-5.4.0, zero values were completely ignored in stackedbars plots.
From PHPlot-5.4.0 through PHPlot-5.6.0, a zero value at the end of a data
row (or an all zero row) would result in a color 'cap' on the top of the bar
stack, but this was changed in PHPlot-5.7.0.
</para>

<sect2 id="plottype-thinbarline">
<title>Plot Type: thinbarline</title>
<para>
This plot type draws lines from the axis to the data value.
Other implementations call this type of plot <emphasis>impulses</emphasis>.
Both vertical and horizontal thinbarline plots are available.
Plotting multiple data sets does not work, because the lines are drawn on
top of each other and only one can typically be seen.
This plot type can be more readable than a bar chart when there are a large
number of data points.
</para>
<para>
For vertical plots, use data type <xref linkend="text-data"/>
or <xref linkend="data-data"/>.
For 'text-data', the data X values are assumed to be at 0.5+N for N=0,1,2...
For horizontal plots, use data type <xref linkend="text-data-yx"/>
or <xref linkend="data-data-yx"/>.
For 'text-data-yx', the data Y values are assumed to be at 0.5+N for N=0,1,2...
</para>
<para>
The width of the plot lines can be controlled with <xref linkend="SetLineWidths" />.
</para>
<para>
An empty string (or any non-numeric value) for the dependent variable
(Y for vertical plots, X for horizontal plots) indicates a missing point.
No line will be drawn at missing point positions.

    <para>
A color name, as defined by <xref linkend="SetRGBArray" /> or from a built-in

Note that color names are case sensitive.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
Numeric color component values, in the form <literal>#rrggbb</literal>.
Here rr is red, gg is green, and bb is blue, and each component
value is represented as a 2-digit hexadecimal number between 00 and ff.
For example, <literal>#0000ff</literal> is full-saturation blue.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
A PHP array of red, green, and blue color component values, each value
being in the range 0 to 255 inclusive, for example
<literal>array(0,0,255)</literal> for blue.

<note>
  <para>
You cannot use the (red, green, blue) array form as a color value in those
functions (like <xref linkend="SetDataColors" />) which accept either a
single color or an array of colors. The functions are unable to distinguish
between an array of colors and a single color represented as an array.
However, you can work around this restriction by using an array containing
the array with the colors, for example:
<literal>array(array(102, 0, 192))</literal>.

<para>
An additional color list is used with error plots. These have data type
<literal>data-data-error</literal> or <literal>data-data-yx-error</literal>
(see <xref linkend="conc-datatypes-types"/>).
The positive and negative error bars use a color map that is set using
<xref linkend="SetErrorBarColors"/>. By default, this color list contains
the same colors as the data color list, so each data set and its error bars
will be in the same color. If you change the data colors list with
<xref linkend="SetDataColors"/>, you probably want to change the error bar
color list too, so you get the same colors for data sets and their error bars.
</para>
<para>
In bar charts and stackedbar charts, the bars will have borders if shading is
off, or if <xref linkend="SetDrawDataBorders"/><literal>(True)</literal> is
used.  The colors used for the bar borders can be set with
<xref linkend="SetDataBorderColors"/>.
By default, a black outline is used for all data sets, if borders are on.
</para>
<para>
Note: PHPlot through version 5.0.7 used 8 colors in the default Data Colors
list: SkyBlue, green, orange, blue, orange, red, violet, and azure1.
If plotting more than four data sets with PHPlot-5.0.7 or earlier, you should
use <xref linkend="SetDataColors" /> to define your own data colors list.
Otherwise you will get two data sets plotted in the same color, orange.
</para>

<para>
Instead of using sequential data colors for plotted data sets, you can
control exactly which data color is used for each data value using the
data color callback.
For more information, see <xref linkend="adv-datacolor-callback"/>.
</para>

<para>
Some plot types which only support a single data set still use multiple
data colors, but in a way that is specific to that plot type.  This is
described for each applicable plot type in <xref linkend="conc-plottypes"/>.
For example, the 3 OHLC financial plot types use the first 4 data colors for
different parts of the marker at each data point, as well as to indicate
the overall direction (up or down). You can use the same methods -
<xref linkend="SetDataColors"/> or a data color callback - to change colors
for these plot types.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="conc-colors-transparent">
<title>Transparency</title>
<para>
You can designate one color in the color map to be transparent.
This is most often used to make a plot with a transparent background.
Use <xref linkend="SetTransparentColor" /> to designate the color,
and <xref linkend="SetBackgroundColor" /> to use that color for the background.
Use a color which is not otherwise used in the plot.
</para>
<para>
For transparency to work, the output format (see <xref linkend="SetFileFormat" />)
must support transparency, and the the user's viewer or browser also must
support transparency.
If transparency is not supported, the user will see the actual color
which was designated as transparent (so don't use red, for example).
Most viewers support transparency in GIF format, and newer viewers should
support transparency in PNG format.  JPEG format does not support
transparency.
</para>

The following table shows the function(s) used to set the color of each
element on a plot, and the default color if no functions are used to change it.
Where multiple function names are shown, they are listed from highest to

The following notes apply to the table of plot element colors above:
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
<xref linkend="SetPieBorderColor"/> was added in PHPlot-6.0.0. In prior
releases, pie segment borders (which were available only on unshaded pie
charts) used the color set with <xref linkend="SetGridColor"/>.
The new function is backwards compatible, as the borders default to the grid
color if <function>SetPieBorderColor</function> is not used.
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
<xref linkend="SetDataLabelColor"/>,
<xref linkend="SetDataValueLabelColor"/>,
<xref linkend="SetPieLabelColor"/>, and
<xref linkend="SetTickLabelColor"/> were added in PHPlot-5.7.0.
Through PHPlot-5.6.0:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
Tick labels and axis data labels all used the color set with
<xref linkend="SetTextColor"/>.
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
Data value labels (incorrectly) used the title color set with
<xref linkend="SetTitleColor"/>.
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
Pie chart labels used the grid color set with <xref linkend="SetGridColor"/>.
            </para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
Except for data value labels, the defaults are backwards compatible. That
is, if you use <function>SetGridColor()</function> and do not use the new
<function>SetPieLabelColor()</function>, your pie chart labels will display
in the same color with all releases.
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
The legend background uses the overall image background color set with
<xref linkend="SetBackgroundColor"/> by default.
Starting with PHPlot-6.0.0, you can set the legend background color
separately with <xref linkend="SetLegendBgColor"/>.
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
The legend color box borders use the color set with
<xref linkend="SetTextColor"/> by default. Starting with PHPlot-6.0.0,
you can use the colors set with <xref linkend="SetDataBorderColors"/>
instead. See <xref linkend="SetLegendColorboxBorders"/>.
      </para>

<sect2 id="conc-labels-tick">
<title>Tick Labels</title>
<para>
Tick labels identify the X or Y values at tick positions (even if the tick
marks themselves are not drawn).
See <xref linkend="conc-ticks"/> for information about the tick positions.
</para>

<para>
Note that even with data type 'data-data', where explicit independent
variable values for the data are supplied, the tick positions and labels
along that axis are still calculated automatically (unless modified by the
available functions).
For example, for vertical plots, your supplied X values in the
data array are not used for the X tick labels.
</para>

<para>
You can enable, disable, or position the tick labels with
<xref linkend="SetXTickLabelPos" /> and <xref linkend="SetYTickLabelPos" />.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="conc-labels-data">
<title>Axis Data Labels</title>
<para>
Axis data labels are available for the independent variable axis. This is X
for vertical plots, and Y for horizontal plots.
These data labels are supplied in your data array for each data point.
For example, with data type text-data :
<programlisting><![CDATA[$data = array( array('Peaches',100),
               array('Apples', 140),
               array('Pears', 90));
]]></programlisting>
The three points have data labels 'Peaches', 'Apples', and 'Pears'.
For vertical plots, these data labels will be drawn at the bottom of the plot
(by default) below the corresponding X values.
For horizontal plots, these data labels will be drawn to the left of the plot
(by default), to the left of the corresponding Y values.
You can disable or reposition the data labels with
<xref linkend="SetXDataLabelPos" /> and
<xref linkend="SetYDataLabelPos" />.
</para>

<note>
  <para>
The axis data labels are not necessarily drawn along axis lines. They are
usually drawn along the bottom (for X) or left side (for Y) of the plot.
Although these are also the usual positions for the X axis and Y axis, the
actual axis lines may be drawn elsewhere.
See <xref linkend="SetXAxisPosition"/> or <xref linkend="SetYAxisPosition"/>
for more information on axis positions.
  </para>
</note>

<para>
You will generally not want both tick labels and axis data labels on,
because they will overlap and be unreadable. If you are not using data
labels, you should either make them all empty strings in your data array,
or else use <xref linkend="SetXDataLabelPos"/>('none') (for vertical plots)
or <xref linkend="SetYDataLabelPos"/>('none') (for horizontal plots)
to turn them off.
You can also call <xref linkend="SetXTickLabelPos"/> (for vertical plots)
or <xref linkend="SetYTickLabelPos"/> (for horizontal plots)
to explicitly position the tick labels.
PHPlot will then disable the data labels.
</para>

<para>
If you don't tell PHPlot what to do with data and tick labels,
the behavior depends on the PHPlot version.
PHPlot 5.1.0 and later will examine your data array to see if there are any
non-empty data labels, and if so it will draw only data labels, and omit
tick labels.
If all of the labels in your data array are empty, tick labels will be drawn.
(PHPlot through 5.0.7 will draw both tick and data labels in these cases.)
</para>

<sect2 id="conc-labels-datavalue">
<title>Data Value Labels</title>
<para>
Data value labels are available only for some plot types.
These are displayed inside the plot, and show the value at
each data point, bar, or bar segment.
</para>
<para>
For vertical bar charts, Y data value labels indicate the Y value for each
bar, and are drawn above the bar for positive values, or below the bar for
negative values.
For vertical stackedbar charts, Y data value labels indicate the total Y
value for each stack, and optionally indicate the value of each segment.
Use <xref linkend="SetYDataLabelPos" /> to enable Y data value labels.
</para>
<para>
For horizontal bar charts, X data value labels indicate the X value for each
bar, and are drawn to the left or right of the end of the bar.
For horizontal stackedbar charts, X data value labels indicate the total X
value for each stack, and optionally indicate the value of each segment.
Use <xref linkend="SetXDataLabelPos" /> to enable X data value labels.
</para>

<para>
Y data value labels are also available for vertical plots of types
lines, linepoints, points, and squared (starting in PHPlot-5.3.0).
X data value labels are available for horizontal plots of types
lines, linepoints, and points (starting in PHPlot-6.0.0).
The data value labels indicate the value of each point and are displayed
(by default) above each point.
Use <xref linkend="SetYDataLabelPos" /> to enable Y data value labels for
these vertical plots, and <xref linkend="SetXDataLabelPos" /> to enable X
data value labels for these horizontal plots.
PHPlot does not attempt to prevent interference between the labels and
other plot elements.
To change the position of the labels, see <xref linkend="adv-tuning-labels"/>.
</para>

<para>
Data value labels are not available with other plot types.
</para>

<para>
  <note>
    <para>
The same function is used to position X axis data labels and X data value
labels, and the same function is used to position Y axis data labels and Y data
value labels. There is no ambiguity, because one type of label is available
for each axis for vertical plots, and the other type for horizontal plots.

Pie chart labels identify segments on a pie chart. By default, these
show the percentage of each segment, relative to the whole pie. Starting

<sect2 id="conc-labels-format">
<title>Formatting Labels</title>
<para>
Tick labels, data labels, and pie chart labels are subject to format controls.
There are several choices in formatting.  By default, the label value itself
is simply displayed.
Use <xref linkend="SetXLabelType" /> and <xref linkend="SetYLabelType" /> to
select one of the other format types for tick labels.
Use <xref linkend="SetXDataLabelType" /> and
<xref linkend="SetYDataLabelType" /> to select one of the other format
types for data labels (both axis data labels and data value labels).
(Note that SetXLabelType also sets the default format for X data labels,
for use if SetXDataLabelType is not called.
Also SetYLabelType sets the default for Y data labels, for use if
SetYDataLabelType is not called.)
Use <xref linkend="SetPieLabelType"/> to select a format type for pie chart
labels.
</para>

<para>
The following sections contain details of the available formatting types.
More examples can be found in the reference page for
<xref linkend="SetXLabelType"/>.
</para>

<sect3 id="conc-labels-format-data">
<title>Formatting Labels: 'data' type</title>
<para>
Label format type 'data' expects the tick label, data label, or pie label
values to be numbers, and formats the values as floating point numbers with
a separator between every group of thousands and a fixed number of decimal
places.  You can set the number of digits of precision, with the default
being 1 digit. You can also set a prefix and/or suffix string (such as a
currency symbol or percent sign).
PHPlot will try to set the thousands grouping separator and
decimal separator according to your locale, but this can be overridden if
necessary.
</para>
<para>
For example:
  <programlisting><![CDATA[$plot->SetYLabelType('data', 2, '$');
]]></programlisting>
This might format the value 1234.567 as "$1,234.57" (depending on locale).
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="conc-labels-format-time">
<title>Formatting Labels: 'time' type</title>
<para>
Label format type 'time' expects the tick or data label values to be a PHP time
value (number of seconds since a fixed base data, the Unix Epoch).
PHPlot will format the labels according to the format string you provide.
Refer to the PHP documentation for <function>strftime()</function> for
details on the format string.
</para>
<para>
For example:
  <programlisting><![CDATA[$plot->SetXLabelType('time', $format);
]]></programlisting>
If a label value is the numeric equivalent of "31 December 2004 at 1:23:45 pm"
(which is 1104517425 on some platforms), the following table shows some
examples of the result with different values of $format:

    </tbody>
  </tgroup>
</informaltable>
(This formatting type is generally not applicable to pie chart labels.)
</para>

<note>
  <para>
If you select 'time' formatting, but don't set a time format string,
PHPlot-5.0rc3 and higher will format the values as hours, minutes, and
seconds as shown in the last row of the table above.
(The default format was undefined before version 5.0rc3.)
  </para>
  <para>
Also note that there are limits to the range of this type of formatting
that can make it unusable for historical data. On some platforms, dates
before 1970-01-01 can not be formatted.
  </para>
  <para>
Starting with PHPlot-5.0.4, empty string values for data labels are
ignored for 'time' and 'data' formatting. Earlier versions would format
the labels as 0 (for 'data') or cause an error (for 'time').
  </para>
</note>

<para>
While date/time formatting can be useful, for X values it may be
easier to just format the label values in your PHP code and put the result
into the label positions in the data array. If you need date/time formatting for
Y values (and it is hard to imagine where that would be useful), you have
no option but to use the 'time' format labels for tick values.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="conc-labels-format-printf">
<title>Formatting Labels: 'printf' type</title>
<para>
Label format type 'printf' expects a second argument specifying a
<function>printf</function> format string, and formats the label value
according to the string.
The format string must contain exactly one conversion specification
(%-code) which consumes a single argument.
For example:
  <programlisting><![CDATA[$plot->SetYLabelType('printf', '%8.2e parsecs');
]]></programlisting>
This might produce a label like " 1.23e+8 parsecs".
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="conc-labels-format-custom">
<title>Formatting Labels: 'custom' type</title>
<para>
A user-defined function can be provided to format labels. Specify
formatting type 'custom', and provide the name of your function as
a string. (This is actually a PHP <emphasis>callback</emphasis> type
argument, which can also be an array containing an object and a method
name. See the PHP documentation on callbacks for more details.)
You can provide an additional argument which will be passed
to your function when formatting labels (a
<emphasis>pass-through</emphasis> argument).
</para>

<para>
In this example, the user-provided function is called
<function>my_formatter</function>, and you want an additional argument $data
passed to the function.
  <programlisting><![CDATA[$plot->SetYLabelType('custom', 'my_formatter', $data);
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
Your formatting function will accept 1 or 2 arguments (or more - see below).
  <programlisting><![CDATA[function my_formatter($label, $arg)
{
    ...
    return $some_result;
}
]]></programlisting>
The function will be called with $label set to the value of the label to be
formatted, and is expected to return the formatted label text. $arg is a 
pass-through argument that has whatever value you used with
<function>SetXLabelType</function> (etc.). In the above example, this is
$data. You need to declare this second argument in your function only if
you are using a pass-through argument.
</para>

<note>
  <para>
PHPlot may call your label formatting function multiple times for the same
label, and your function must return the same value each time.
Also, do not rely on the labels being formatted in any particular order.
  </para>
  <para>
A custom label formatting function will not be called at all if the
label value is an empty string (<literal>''</literal>).
This generally only applies to axis data labels (the label strings in
your data array), since others are numbers.
This means you cannot use custom label formatting to replace an empty
string with something else. The custom label formatting function
will be called if the label string is anything other than an empty
string, such as a string with single space.
  </para>
</note>

<para>
Custom label formatting is extremely flexible. You can convert values into
another format (for example, degrees, minutes, seconds), or look up values
in an external array (see <xref linkend="ex-bubbles1"/>), for example.
However, using this method, you can only selectively format or display labels
based on their value. For even more control, use the additional arguments
provided to the formatting function which are described in the next section.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="conc-labels-format-custom2">
<title>Formatting Labels: Extended 'custom' type</title>
<para>
When you use 'custom' formatting type, PHPlot actually provides 0, 1, or 2
additional arguments to your callback. These identify the row, or row and
column, of the data point being labeled. You can use these extra arguments
in your callback for selective formatting or filtering based on the
position of the point being plotted in your data array.
</para>

<para>
PHPlot provides the following additional arguments to a custom label
formatting callback (after the label value and pass-through arguments):

  </tgroup>
</informaltable>
</para>

<para>
You need not declare these arguments unless you are using them, but if you
do declare them, it is safer to make them optional with default NULL.
(If you are only using the custom callback function for one specific type of
label, you can omit the defaults.)
For example:
  <programlisting><![CDATA[function my_formatter($label, $arg, $row=NULL, $column=NULL)
{
    ...
    return $some_result;
}
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
The <emphasis>row</emphasis> argument value is an index starting with zero
that numbers the rows in your data array. This corresponds to the ordinal
position of the independent variable (X for vertical plots, Y for
horizontal plots). This is also the outer index of your data array.
</para>

<para>
The <emphasis>column</emphasis> argument value is an index starting with zero
that numbers the data sets in each row. This corresponds to the ordinal
position of the dependent variable (Y for vertical plots, X for
horizontal plots). Note that this is not simply the inner index of your
data array, because the data array rows also have labels, and (depending on
the data type) may contain other values.
For example, given the data type <literal>data-data</literal> and this data
array:
  <programlisting><![CDATA[$data = array(
    array('Jan', 1,  10, 11, 12),
    array('Feb', 2,  20, 21, 22),
    array('Mar', 3,  30, 31, 32),
);
]]></programlisting>
When formatting a data value label for X=2, Y=22 (the 3rd data set in
the row labeled 'Feb'), PHPlot will call a custom label formatting function
like this:
  <programlisting><![CDATA[my_formatter(22, $passthrough, 1, 2);
]]></programlisting>
That is, row=1 and column=2.
</para>

<para>
As described in <xref linkend="conc-labels-format-custom"/>, your callback
function returns the value of the formatted label. You can return an empty
string to display no label. This can be used to display data value labels
for only one data set, for example - just return an empty string if $column
is not equal to the index of the data set you want to label.
</para>

<para>
See <xref linkend="ex-dlexformat"/> for an example.

These additional row and column arguments are only available
starting with PHPlot-5.8.0.

Tick marks are drawn by default along the bottom edge of the plot (X tick

These usually, but not always, correspond to the X and Y axis lines.
You can set the tick interval or control the number of ticks, suppress the
first or last tick on an axis, and control the tick mark size.
You can also anchor the tick marks at a specific X or Y value.
For a list of functions used to control tick marks,

<para>
Left to its own, PHPlot will determine tick positions for X and Y axes.
(See <xref linkend="adv-autorange-tick"/> if you want to read all the
details on how PHPlot does this.)
Starting with PHPlot-6.0.0, an attempt is made to pick a good tick increment.
(Older releases are much less likely to come up with a good result.)
Even so, you might not be happy with the results.
You can improve the situation with some combination of: setting
the desired tick interval, setting a tick anchor point, or using
<xref linkend="SetPlotAreaWorld" /> to set the X or Y data range limits
(since the automatic calculation of tick marks is based on the data range).
</para>

<para>
 For example:
<programlisting><![CDATA[$plot->SetPlotAreaWorld(-10, NULL, 10, NULL);

PHPlot supports both built-in GD fonts and TrueType fonts (if available on
your system).
TrueType fonts generally produce higher quality text, but using them
requires more internal computations. The built-in GD fonts are faster
to render, but are limited to one typeface and 5 available sizes.
TrueType fonts can be drawn at any size and angle, and many typefaces are
available.
On most systems, TrueType fonts are anti-aliased for improved appearance,
but under some conditions the GD fonts may be easier to read.
TrueType fonts support much wider character sets, including special
symbols, while the GD fonts are more limited.

Notes: <literal>generic</literal> is also used for text drawn from a callback
when no font is specified. See <xref linkend="callbacks-drawing"/>
and <xref linkend="DrawText"/>. Although <literal>generic</literal> is
used for error image text, changing the font or size has no effect because
the error handler resets the font to the default before displaying the error.
Message image text refers to <xref linkend="DrawMessage"/>.

<title>TrueType Font Selection</title>
<para>
PHPlot text can use built-in GD fonts or TrueType fonts. When using GD
fonts, you specify a font name as a number between 1 and 5. This selects
from 5 built-in GD fonts.
When using TrueType fonts, you need to specify a font filename.
The rest of this section discusses only TrueType fonts.
</para>

<note>
  <para>
The material on specifying font files for PHPlot applies to releases
starting with PHPlot-5.1.3. Through PHPlot-5.1.2, you generally need to specify
the full pathname of a font file, or the full path of a font directory.
  </para>
</note>

<para>
On Windows systems, you need to use the font filename, not the font name.
You can get the font filename using Control Panel - Fonts.
For example, Windows applications may display "Arial Black", or "Arial
Black (TrueType)" as a font name, but the actual font filename is "ariblk.ttf".
Since GD knows to look for fonts in the Windows font directory, you will
not need to specify a full pathname to font files, unless the font is
installed in some other directory.
</para>

<para>
On Windows, you can use the "Character Map" system tool to examine a font.
This can also be used to find the Unicode character code of a special character.
These will be displayed in hexadecimal, for example U+20AC for the Euro.
See <xref linkend="conc-text-special"/>
for more information on using special characters.
</para>

<para>
Here are some font selection examples for Windows:
<programlisting><![CDATA[# For titles, use Arial Bold Italic at 14 points:
$plot->SetFontTTF('title', 'ARIALBI.TTF', 14)
# For X Title, use Verdana at 12 points:
$plot->SetFontTTF('x_title', 'VERDANA.TTF', 12)
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
On some Linux and similar systems, GD is able to find fonts specified
without paths, but on other systems you will have to specify a font
directory with either <xref linkend="SetTTFPath"/> or as part of the
font name in <xref linkend="SetFontTTF"/>.
If you specify a full pathname to a font, you must also supply the extension
(.ttf); you may omit the extension when relying on GD to find the font.
Remember that font filenames are case sensitive on most of these systems.
</para>

<para>
The font search path for GD (bundled with PHP) includes the following
directories on Linux and similar systems:
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><filename>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType</filename></para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><filename>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/truetype</filename></para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><filename>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TTF</filename></para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><filename>/usr/share/fonts/TrueType</filename></para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><filename>/usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType</filename></para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
If your system has TrueType fonts in one of those directories, you can
select them with a filename only. If not, you must use a full directory path
in either the font name or with SetTTFPath.
</para>
<note>
  <para>
The environment variable <envar>GDFONTPATH</envar> can be defined to
contain a list of directories (separated by a colon ':') to search for
fonts. If defined, this replaces the above list.
  </para>
</note>

<para>
Your Linux system may include a tool for examining fonts. One such tool is
<application>gucharmap</application>.
This can also be used to find the Unicode character code of a special character.
These may be displayed in hexadecimal, for example U+20AC for the Euro.
See the next section for more information on using special characters.
</para>

<para>
Here are some font selection examples for Linux:
<programlisting><![CDATA[# On systems with fonts in an expected place, like Slackware Linux,
# just use the font filename:
# For titles, use Liberation Sans Bold Italic at 14 points:
$plot->SetFontTTF('title', 'LiberationSans-BoldItalic.ttf', 14)
# For X Title, use DejaVuSans Bold at 12 points:
$plot->SetFontTTF('x_title', 'DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf', 12)

# Ubuntu and Debian use subdirectories under a searched path.
# You can use a partial path here.
$plot->SetFontTTF('x_title', 'liberation/LiberationSans-Regular.ttf', 12)
# Note: Older Ubuntu/Debian used the path ttf-liberation/...

# Fedora uses subdirectories which are not under a searched path.
# You must use full paths here.
$plot->SetTTFPath('/usr/share/fonts/liberation/');
$plot->SetFontTTF('x_title', 'LiberationSans-Regular.ttf', 12)
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<note>
  <para>
Your Linux system probably has a package called <literal>fontconfig</literal>
which is used to provide more consistent access to fonts. But even if your
system uses a version of the <literal>gd</literal> library which is built
with <literal>fontconfig</literal> (and the one bundled with PHP does not),
<emphasis>PHP does not use <literal>fontconfig</literal></emphasis>.
Therefore PHPlot needs to be able to locate font files using other means.
  </para>
</note>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="conc-text-defaultfont">
<title>Default TrueType Font</title>
<note>
  <para>
This section applies starting with PHPlot-5.1.3.
  </para>
</note>
<para>
If you try to use TrueType text without specifying a font name, PHPlot will
use the default font. You can set the default font with
<xref linkend="SetDefaultTTFont"/>. If you do not set a default font,
PHPlot tries to locate a sans-serif font to use. Here are the font names
that PHPlot tries in order. First it tries the filename alone, letting GD
use its search path, and then it tries with the default font path, as set
with <xref linkend="SetTTFPath"/>.
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
<filename>LiberationSans-Regular.ttf</filename>
- Likely to work on Linux and other systems with a correct GD font search path.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
<filename>Verdana.ttf, Arial.ttf, Helvetica.ttf</filename>
- One of these is going to work on Windows, maybe other systems too.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
<filename>liberation/LiberationSans-Regular.ttf,
          ttf-liberation/LiberationSans-Regular.ttf</filename>
- This is for Debian, Ubuntu, and similar (the first is for newer releases,
such as Ubuntu 12.04 and later, and the second is for older releases).
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
<filename>benjamingothic.ttf</filename>
- The original PHPlot default, for compatibility.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
The last item on the list is used regardless of whether it can be found or
not. This means if you enable TrueType fonts without setting a default, and
get a fatal error from PHPlot that it can't find the font benjamingothic.ttf,
this means PHPlot was unable to find any of the standard fonts in its list.
On that system, then, you must provide either a font directory, or use full
font pathnames.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="conc-text-special">
<title>Using Special Characters</title>
<para>
You can include special characters in your PHPlot labels and titles. This
refers to characters which you may not be able to type with a single key
on your keyboard, including accented characters and special symbols.
</para>

<para>
PHPlot itself does not do any special processing of text strings, so you
should refer to the PHP GD and Image Functions reference for more
information.
</para>

<note>
  <para>
This mostly only works with TrueType fonts. The built-in GD fonts do
have some extended characters, but they are encoded in ISO8859-2 which is
probably not what you might expect, and the GD font routines do not support
special character entities.
  </para>
</note>

<para>
To use special characters in your PHPlot text strings, you need a TrueType
font that contains the characters you want. Ideally, you want a Unicode
font. You might have to examine the font using an operating system-specific
tool to see if your characters are present and to find their numeric values.
</para>

<para>
There are two basic ways to include special characters in your text
strings. The examples below use the Euro character, which is decimal
Unicode value 8364.
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
Use HTML-type character entities with decimal numeric encoding. For
example, the Unicode Euro symbol is: &amp;#8364;
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
Include the UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode value in your string as a series
of hex escapes. For example, the Euro symbol is: "\xe2\x82\xac".
    </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>
These are shown in the example below, both of which set the Y axis title to
"Items per &euro;100".
<programlisting><![CDATA[$plot->SetYTitle("Items per &#8364;100"); # Numeric character entity
$plot->SetYTitle("Items per \xe2\x82\xac100"); # UTF-8 encoding
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
You can also use PHP functions to encode your characters for including in
PHPlot text strings. See the PHP documentation for the functions
<function>html_entity_decode()</function>
and <function>iconv()</function>.
Here are some examples (sent in by SourceForge user 'kalvaro'):
<programlisting><![CDATA[# Encode the Euro symbol into UTF-8:
$chars = html_entity_decode('&euro;', ENT_NOQUOTES, 'UTF-8');

# Use iconv() to convert a character value xA4 in ISO-8859-15 to UTF:
$chars = iconv('iso-8859-15', 'utf-8', chr(0xA4));
]]></programlisting>
</para>
</sect2>

<note>
  <para>
GD does not support using named character entities such as &amp;euro; directly
in strings - they must be numerically encoded as described above.
  </para>

<sect1 id="conc-errors">
<title>Error Handling</title>
<abstract><title></title>
  <para>
This section describes error handling in PHPlot. This information may not
be accurate for PHPlot-5.0.4 and earlier.
  </para>
</abstract>

<sect2 id="conc-errors-overview">
<title>Error Handling Overview</title>
<para>
Errors detected within PHPlot are programming or installation errors. These
are conditions that web application users should never see, because they
should be detected and corrected before an application is deployed.
Therefore, error handling in PHPlot is aimed more at the developer
than the application user.
</para>
<para>
PHPlot does the following by default when an error is detected:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
Creates an error image - an image containing the text of the error message.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
Outputs the error image to standard output or to a file, depending on where
the plot image was supposed to go.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
Triggers a user-level error condition.
If an error handler has been established, it determines what happens next.
Otherwise, with no error handler:
Writes the error message to error output, or logs it to the
web server error log, depending on the PHPlot SAPI in use.
Then the script will exit with a non-zero exit status.
    </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
It is important not to have any text sent to standard output, even when
an error occurs, or the image will be corrupted or PHP will display a "headers
already sent" error and no image. Therefore it is necessary to turn off the
PHP <command>display_errors</command> parameter, otherwise PHP will also
write the error messages to standard output. This can be turned off in the
php.ini configuration file, where it affects all scripts, or in an
application script using:
<programlisting><![CDATA[ini_set('display_errors', 'off');
]]></programlisting>
</para>
<para>
Note that an image is produced and output on error even if
<function>SetPrintImage(False)</function> is used to suppress or delay
the normal output of a plot image. The error image is meant for the application
developer or tester, but you need to see the error message in order to fix
the problem which caused it, so the image is output when the error occurs.
</para>
<para>
<?dbfo keep-together="always"?>
The following figure shows an example of an error image resulting from
<function>$plot->SetPlotType('dots')</function>:
  <informalfigure>
    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="images/error-image.png" scale="58" format="PNG" />
      </imageobject>
      <textobject>
        <phrase>Example of an error image</phrase>
      </textobject>
    </mediaobject>
  </informalfigure>
</para>

<para>
You can disable the error image entirely using
<xref linkend="SetFailureImage"/> (added in PHPlot-5.5.0).
One case where this is recommended is when your script will use
<xref linkend="EncodeImage"/> to get the plot image, rather than sending
it to a file or back to the browser. Since your script is not intended to ever
produce an image, it should not produce an error image either.
</para>

<para>
If a failure occurs when error images are disabled with
<xref linkend="SetFailureImage"/>, PHPlot will still trigger a user-level error 
condition, which will normally record the error message in the server log,
and terminate the script. However, there will be no feedback to the user that
the error occurred. 
If using <literal>SetFailureImage(False)</literal> to disable error images,
you should place this call right after creating the PHPlot object, because
an error which occurs before the call will produce an error image.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="conc-errors-types">
<title>Types of Errors</title>
<para>
The following types of errors can occur within PHPlot:
<orderedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
Parameter value errors: Use of an incorrect argument to a PHPlot function,
such as: SetPlotType('dots') ['dots' is not a valid plot type].
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
Semantic errors: Invalid combination of parameters or data values, such as
trying to use data type 'data-data' with plot type 'bars' [bar charts only
work with 'text-data' data type].
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
Pathname errors: Missing font file or invalid font path; missing or
invalid image file used as background. It might seem extreme to have a
missing font file be a fatal error, but PHPlot has no way to substitute an
appropriate font, and a missing font would indicate an application
configuration or installation error.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
Inability to create a GD image resource. Probably the only way this can
happen is if there is insufficient memory, which can occur if PHP's
configured per-script memory limit is reached. (See note below)
    </para>
  </listitem>
</orderedlist>
All of these result in an E_USER_ERROR level error, except for memory
exhaustion when creating an image, which is E_ERROR (fatal unrecoverable).
If no GD image resource was created, no error image will be output.
Furthermore, if the reason was memory exhaustion, there is no way to catch
the error and PHP will cause the script to immediately exit.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="conc-errors-handle">
<title>Error Handlers</title>
<para>
It is possible to set up an error handler with PHP's
<function>set_error_handler</function> to catch most errors from PHPlot.
The handler can be established for all errors (the default), or just
E_USER_ERROR error types (the only type PHPlot will trigger).
See the PHP documentation for more details.
Your handler function can perform cleanup before it exits, however it should
not return.
Some of the PHPlot functions will correctly handle a return from an error
handler, and return FALSE to their callers, but not all. At the very least,
a PHPlot object instance should be unset and not re-used after error.
</para>

<para>
Note that if you do choose to have an error handler that returns, a return
value of FALSE from the handler function will result in the standard PHP error
handling, meaning the script will exit with an error message. If you want
your script to continue after the handled error, your error handler must
return TRUE.  (A return with no value, or return of NULL, seems to work the
same as TRUE, but this is not documented.)
</para>

<para>
Note that an error image will be created and output, as described above,
even if you have established an error handler.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="conc-errors-app">
<title>Application-level Errors</title>
<para>
If you would like your application to handle some errors in a similar
manner to PHPlot, you can use <xref linkend="DrawMessage"/> to create
