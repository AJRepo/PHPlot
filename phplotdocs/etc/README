phplotdocs: Extra files

These are extra files and scripts which were originally used to produce the
manual, but are not needed to generate the manual. This includes scripts
used to generate the "static" manual figures. The generated figures are
found as *.png files in the images/ directory. Note that some of the
images were edited, for example to call out features, as noted below.


colors.php
  This makes colors.png, the color chart showing the built-in color map.

fonts.php
  This makes fonts.png, the figure showing built-in and TrueType fonts.

labels-pie.php
  This makes labels-pie.png, figure of pie chart labels, before it is
  annotated to call out the label.

labels.php
  A basic bar chart, used to produce labels.png before it is annotated.

typical.png
  A plot used as the basis for several figures: typical-grid.png,
  typical-legend.png, typical-titles.png.
  The output is annotated to call out the different label types.

Note: Other figures were either created on the fly or the original
generating script has been misplaced:
  gdinfo.png : Copied from a phpinfo() output
  ticksize.png : Unknown source
  legendstyle.png : Multiple copy-and-paste from a unknown script.
