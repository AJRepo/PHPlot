The project home page is http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplot/
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2012-02-06
    * drawmessage*.php: Added 8 new tests for DrawMessage()
    * ex-drawmessage.php: Added 1 new test from Reference Manual example
      of DrawMessage().
    * tests.ini: List 9 new tests

2012-01-09
    * backgroundreset*.php: Added 4 new tests. These are actually old tests,
      from 2010-12-26 work on resetting the background with multiple plots
      on an image, but they never got added to the test suite.
    * tests.ini: List 4 new tests

2012-01-02
    * ex-pielabeltype: Resync to example from the manual. This removes two
      data rows which were too small to display.

2012-01-01
    * LICENSES: Update copyright year, no change to licenses.

2011-12-30
    Add 70 new tests and 1 data file, for the pie sizing and label changes.
    * ex-pielabeltype*.php: New example files and data file, from the manual.
    * multipie.php, pieautosize*.php, pieminautosize*.php, pieminsize*.php,
      piesize*.php: New tests for pie sizing and label types.
    * Makefile: List new dependent file
    * tests.ini: Add 70 new tests to run

2011-12-21
    * multiplot.php: Added option for plot-area-relative legend positioning,
      to fix the test failure in multiplot2 with new pie chart code.
    * multiplot2.php: Use new plot-area-relative legend positioning, not world
      coordinates. This fixes a test failure with the new pie chart code,
      which does not set up world coordinate mapping with pie charts. World
      coordinates don't make sense for pie charts and this should not have
      worked before.

2011-12-10
    * LICENSES: Fix typo, no change to licenses.

2011-08-24
    * tests.ini: Fix validation pattern for encodeimg1 per previous change.

2011-08-19
    * encodeimg1.php: Fix message from test so it does not contain the path
      to the results directory, to avoid spurious result compare errors.

2011-08-08
    * The PHPlot Test Suite is imported into SubVersion. No prior change
      history is available here (although the test suite development goes
      back to 2006).
