This is the Change Log for phplottest, the PHPlot Test Suite
The project home page is http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplot/

2012-08-20
    Added 6 new tests. These are related to bug #3557510 "Calculated defaults
    applied to subsequent plots". Details:
    * multidefault-axis[12].php: Calculated default axis position sticks to
      next plot (1), unless reset (2). Documented behavior, not a bug.
    * multidefault-labelgrid[12].php: Calculated label position and grid
      on/off stick to next plot (1). Grid part is a bug, to be fixed in
      PHPlot-6.0.0. Label position is not yet determined to be a bug. In
      (2) the label positions are reset.
    * multidefault-labelangle1.php: X data label angle defaults to X label
      angle, but sticks even if X label angle changes. Will be fixed in 6.0.0.
    * multidefault-tickinc1.php: Tick increment needs to be calculated again
      for each plot. PHPlot-5.8.0 does this right. 6.0.0 in development was
      broken for a while, but now does it right too.

    Fixed multiple tests that broke with an upcoming change for PHPlot-6.0.0
    which makes most class variables protected visibility. In most cases,
    the fix was to use a new class which extends PHPlot and allows access
    to the needed variable(s).  No changes to test output.
    * colors.php: Allow access to $rgb_array.
    * defaultfont1a.php, defaultfont2a.php: Allow access to $default_ttfont.
    * linepoints1.php: Allow access to $point_shapes.
    * stream2.php: Allow access to $stream_frame_header, $stream_boundary.
    * u.FindDataLimits: Allow access to internal methods CheckDataArray()
      and FindDataLimits(), and to the 4 min/max x/y variables.
    * u.dvlpos.php: Make a new object for each case, instead of reusing it
      and doing unset() on the tuning variables.  Also, removed compatibility
      code for PHPlot-5.7.0 and older. The test now requires 5.8.0 or higher.
    * u.pmarg.php: Allow access to $plot_area.
    * u.setcolors.php: Allow access to $default_colors, $data_colors,
      $data_border_colors, $error_bar_colors.

2012-08-03
    * u.tickanchor.php: Fixed test failure on new "Rel6" branch code, due
      to internal changes, by going through to DrawGraph() before fetching
      the tick values. No changes to test output.
      Also fixed typo (unreachable return).
    * drawtextfont.php: Fix typo in variable name. No changes to test.
    * overlay3.php: Need to turn off Y grid before second plot, else it
      draws over the grid a second time which may or may not change the
      plot appearance.
    * resets3.php: Add a comment explaining the odd values on the Y axis of
      the lower plot, after settings are reset from the top plot.

2012-07-27
    New tests for release 6.0.0 changes to SetPlotAreaWorld() range checking:
    * error-SetPlotAreaWorld*.php : 10 new tests
    * tests.ini: List 10 new tests.

2012-07-26
    * misc-a1.php: Removed incorrect comment about color definition, and
      removed unneeded colors from the map. This goes along with corrections
      made to the reference manual for SetRGBArray() on 2012-06-12 in the
      "Rel6" branch for release 6.0.0. (It is not necessary to define
      PHPlot's internally-used colors in the custom color map.)
      No change to test output.
    * misc-a2.php: New test for error detection in SetRGBArray().
      Note: This test fails (does not detect the error) before PHPlot-6.0.0.
    * ex-pieangle.php: New test from new reference manual example showing
      pie chart start angle and direction setting.
      Note: This test fails before PHPlot-6.0.0.
    * drawtextfont.php: New test of font argument extension in DrawText().
      Note: This test fails before PHPlot-6.0.0.
    * tests.ini: List 3 new tests.

2012-04-26
    * run_test.php: Track and report test "N of M"; report total elapsed time
      at end, and add -match command line option for selecting tests.

2012-04-06
    * serialize1.php : New test for serialize/unserialize
    * tests.ini: List 1 new test.

2012-04-01
    * stream1.php, stream2.php : 2 new tests for streaming plots.
    * tests.ini: List 2 new tests. Total is now 802 tests.

2012-03-24
    * dlexformat*.php: 19 new tests for custom label formatting with
      row and column arguments.
    * ex-dlexformat.php : 1 new test from new reference manual example.
    * tests.ini: List 20 new tests
    * makedata.php: New support script, used by new tests.
    * Makefile: List new support script

    * u.dvlpos.php: Fix test which broke due to new usage of
      CheckDataValueLabels().  Changed to auto-detect old or new usage
      and now works with both.

2012-03-19
    * datalabellines.php: Add support for error plots.
    * datalabellines[cde].php: 3 new tests, data label lines in error plots.
    * tests.ini: List 3 new tests

    * imagemap_html-{b,bu,c,pi,pt}.php: Fix the test output messages so they
      do not contain the path to the results directory, to avoid spurious
      result compare errors.

2012-03-16
    * datalabellines.php: Add support for testing data label lines with
      bubble plots (reference: bug #3506408).
    * datalabellines[9ab].php: 3 new tests, data label lines in bubble plots.
    * tests.ini: List 3 new tests

2012-02-24
    * histogram.php: Resync to example in manual: 1 comment typo fixed, use
      SetDraw[XY]Axis to disable axis lines rather than changing them to
      transparent (which was the only way to do this at the time), and fix
      for no border if draw_border is off. These changes have no effect
      on the test output files.

2012-02-21
    * imagemap_html-*.php: 12 new tests for imagemaps. These produce HTML.
    * imagemap_trace-*.php: 10 new tests for imagemaps. These produce images.
    * imagemap_unit-*.php: 4 new tests for imagemaps. These are unit tests.
    * tests.ini: List 26 new tests for imagemaps

2012-02-18
    * labelcolor*.php, pielabelcolor*.php: New tests for new functions to
      set label colors.
    * tests.ini: List 9 new tests

    * compare_tests.php: Fix typo in script, error with bad command option.

2012-02-17
    * ex-drawmessage.php: Test fails on Windows due to font file not found.
      Fixed to use the config.php file and font name variables for more
      system independence.
    * localepielabel.php: New test for pie label format bug with locale
      using , for decimal point.
    * tests.ini: List new test

2012-02-06
    * drawmessage*.php: Added 8 new tests for DrawMessage()
    * ex-drawmessage.php: Added 1 new test from Reference Manual example
      of DrawMessage().
    * tests.ini: List 9 new tests

2012-01-09
    * backgroundreset*.php: Added 4 new tests. These are actually old tests,
      from 2010-12-26 work on resetting the background with multiple plots
      on an image, but they never got added to the test suite.
    * tests.ini: List 4 new tests

2012-01-02
    * ex-pielabeltype: Resync to example from the manual. This removes two
      data rows which were too small to display.

2012-01-01
    * LICENSES: Update copyright year, no change to licenses.

2011-12-30
    Add 70 new tests and 1 data file, for the pie sizing and label changes.
    * ex-pielabeltype*.php: New example files and data file, from the manual.
    * multipie.php, pieautosize*.php, pieminautosize*.php, pieminsize*.php,
      piesize*.php: New tests for pie sizing and label types.
    * Makefile: List new dependent file
    * tests.ini: Add 70 new tests to run

2011-12-21
    * multiplot.php: Added option for plot-area-relative legend positioning,
      to fix the test failure in multiplot2 with new pie chart code.
    * multiplot2.php: Use new plot-area-relative legend positioning, not world
      coordinates. This fixes a test failure with the new pie chart code,
      which does not set up world coordinate mapping with pie charts. World
      coordinates don't make sense for pie charts and this should not have
      worked before.

2011-12-10
    * LICENSES: Fix typo, no change to licenses.

2011-08-24
    * tests.ini: Fix validation pattern for encodeimg1 per previous change.

2011-08-19
    * encodeimg1.php: Fix message from test so it does not contain the path
      to the results directory, to avoid spurious result compare errors.

2011-08-08
    * The PHPlot Test Suite is imported into SubVersion. No prior change
      history is available here (although the test suite development goes
      back to 2006).
