This is the Change Log for phplottest, the PHPlot Test Suite
The project home page is http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplot/
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011-12-21
    * multiplot.php: Added option for plot-area-relative legend positioning,
      to fix the test failure in multiplot2 with new pie chart code.
    * multiplot2.php: Use new plot-area-relative legend positioning, not world
      coordinates. This fixes a test failure with the new pie chart code,
      which does not set up world coordinate mapping with pie charts. World
      coordinates don't make sense for pie charts and this should not have
      worked before.

2011-12-10
    * LICENSES: Fix typo, no change to licenses.

2011-08-24
    * tests.ini: Fix validation pattern for encodeimg1 per previous change.

2011-08-19
    * encodeimg1.php: Fix message from test so it does not contain the path
      to the results directory, to avoid spurious result compare errors.

2011-08-08
    * The PHPlot Test Suite is imported into SubVersion. No prior change
      history is available here (although the test suite development goes
      back to 2006).
